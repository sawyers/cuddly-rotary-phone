a very long hiatus we were returning to the game
0:05
the characters survived the surviving characters they should say I have just finished a month of
0:13
downtime rest of relaxation um would you like to say what your
0:19
characters have done to win do you want to tell the party what you did or do you
0:24
want to keep it a mystery there's there's no requirements it's it's no mystery um
0:31
the wind used the money he got from the sale of the
0:38
um what we were calling not the uh bacon ranch but what what was the name of the
0:47
the fake potions yeah we sold the we sold the real po uh
0:54
the the share our share of the ocean um got proceeds and he took his share of
1:00
the proceeds uh and the small amount of favor that we had curried with the uh
1:06
with the Temple of mystra and uh cashed in that money to get spell Scrolls and
1:14
uh Scrolls to study to add to his spell book and he's spent the last month
1:20
doing scholarly things learning and practicing those spells
1:28
yep in addition Howard your teacher
1:36
spent some time talking to you about how the real value is is not necessarily
1:44
money or gems for wizards especially even ones in the temple
1:49
it's new spells so he did explain that uh they probably won't have as many
1:56
options to get discounted spells but they would be interested if you come
2:02
across something of getting an equitable trade he also took you to a location in Water
2:10
Deep named troll skull alley and there he introduced you to an
2:15
invitation only store named the bookworms Treasures
2:20
uh in this store uh rumored to be run by a dragon using polymorph uh you can
2:27
purchase any number of rotating inventory of Scrolls magic items
2:35
and the accessibility of a small collection of smelt spell books
2:42
that are rotated through from time to time they do most of their business by
2:50
um let's say providing Financial Services to down on their luck Wizards
2:56
and they have been known to accept spell books as collateral and when the wizard returns they return
3:05
this spell book in the meantime they sell access to those spell books to
3:13
their members for use to copy for us
3:20
your Mentor has introduced you to the manager on the day shift and gotten you
3:26
a membership very nice the the stock is rotating you never
3:34
quite know what you're going to get at any particular time you go there but it is a steady source of spells even
3:43
if you don't always need what they have do they have a
3:49
a guy named Guido that when you he comes out and breaks your kneecaps
3:57
and imagine people yeah threatens to break
4:03
your finger well devastating yeah it's your fingers
4:14
as long as you've turned over your spell book as collateral they're totally fine with you walking away from the dead
4:22
oh that seems kind of dicey
4:28
e go for it recall that uh he has the rather unusual
4:35
uh method of maintaining his spell in his spell book and that he uses copper
4:40
coats and he etches them with acid eventually if you get enough spells just
4:46
snap your back in half foreign
5:01
it's slightly underground but it's nothing illegal and they they do make
5:06
sure that every member can only members are allowed in understand the deal right if you need
5:13
cash you can effectively put items into the pawn shop
5:20
and then when you pay it back plus the big then you get your stuff back
5:25
and your fingers you have to understand
5:34
legal and illegal black and white no it's a relative right
5:40
right just a little bit of Shades of Gray for people um water deep is a little bit unusual in
5:48
that it does have a a lord of waterdeep who this kind of
5:54
functions like you would think of like the British prime minister right and then you've got people behind him
6:00
that are actually doing a lot of the behind the scenes work leaving the prime
6:05
minister to be kind of a figurehead this Council of waterdeep is very
6:11
secretive no one knows exactly who's on it from time to time or what they're doing
6:16
but they are very effective um they're one of the reasons why water
6:22
deep does not have a Thieves Guild they killed them all
6:27
uh they are especially good at rooting out thieves guilds criminal organizations less so with Cults because
6:34
Colts have a very different motivation than thieves guilds or assassin's guilds
6:39
they are more fanatical and willing to die to prevent information from getting
6:44
out so Colts in general are harder to deal with but they do go after them that said
6:51
there is a fair bit of street level crime like small street gang kind of
6:57
things let's be clear there may not be any Thieves Guild that you can join but it's
7:03
because the government runs the only Thieves Guild in town
7:08
they don't want any competition
7:15
hahaha so that that was your month Howard
7:21
Aaron you're next uh I never did get a a note on what you wanted to do for your
7:28
down time so it I guess you just did jerk services do you want to tell anything about church church services
7:35
you know relaxing feuding myself you know but just the
7:41
usual boring stuff that character
7:48
I'm gonna skip everybody else and go to Brad but Brad has walked away
7:54
um I I do a question though um I was intrigued by the the thing that
8:01
you were talking about with the underground bookstore that Howard's been introduced to so
8:08
um are the rest of us not able to I mean not that demaco could do anything there
8:14
but is are we not allowed to go look at that or is that like
8:20
I see you're not a member uh how could vouch for you
8:26
and get you in and and they do have some general use
8:31
magic items that are used to any class um
8:37
but you would be there on dewin's good name I see
8:44
so it's a question of whether to win would want to move out for the party just yet
8:50
uh but yes you wouldn't be allowed in just on your own okay now not not that emico would need
8:57
anything because you know I was just curious uh while you were there Howard I almost
9:04
forgot there's another store in the same area it turns out troll School alley has a
9:12
lot of interesting specialty shops and one that kind of caught your eye too
9:17
technically uh is carillion's Crown which is this kind of dilapidated
9:25
storefront but the second floor has been renovated into a greenhouse above the
9:31
shop and they sell all sorts of plants as you
9:37
would expect uh most interesting for people wanting
9:42
ingredients for potions they also sell a wide selection of flowers and will help you make
9:48
arrangements [Laughter] another one is uh it's a blacksmith Stop
9:56
Shop named steel and steam and steel sorry
10:01
they specialize in custom metal work primarily aimed at uh Westbury
10:15
okay well I I would have Brad go because he's the only original oh there he is
10:22
spread you're the only original character left that hasn't said anything about their month of downtime so yeah
10:31
yeah so you know sesame uh had to put a detailed report together
10:37
to send back to the uh hierarchy of the
10:44
you know Temple of raw or whatever to confirm the suspicions it had brought him there in the first place that there
10:50
were set worshipers in place and you know the hope is that uh
10:55
some point they'll allocate us more alligators to say more resources in order to you know continue to
11:02
investigate that and then um essentially what artifact hunting and um
11:09
was able to pick up a couple of nifty little magic items with the money that uh we got so I've got a uh most
11:16
interesting ones I got a Warhammer of warning which will um
11:22
help keep us from being surprised
11:28
in Random Encounters or whatever so it has a couple other advantages it gives
11:33
me some advantages on um
11:46
yes got really distant and tinny there Brad yeah
11:53
you're back now try talking again try talking again
11:58
good
12:04
anyway could you repeat could you repeat what you said um
12:09
what was the last thing you heard um just it's not a weapon per se okay
12:18
it's not a magic weapon it's not like plus one or anything but it is a magic weapon right so you know I could use it
12:25
for attacks against creatures that can only be hurt by magic items right but no pluses or anything
12:33
um and then he uh then he found he got a cloak of protection out of it too so
12:40
um all of that is useful because you know sese has not a huge hit pool hit point
12:47
pool so it bumps up his armor class maybe and keep you keep some of those hit points
12:52
by not getting hit so I'm just gonna throw it aside here and say cesse is a brick [ __ ] house his AC
12:59
is 22. yeah I was gonna say yeah but my my hit points are 27. yes he is he has
13:06
like he has like t-a-n-k a tattoo
13:14
he's like Tommy Morrison you know he's got a glass jaw
13:25
he's a paladin okay okay level two
13:31
we'll we'll get descriptions of everybody when everybody gets together here shortly
13:37
okay um as far as the the people that you've met um
13:44
you know uh what's his name
13:49
sir Aaron the the Paladin who was helping you from uh ilmitter's Temple
13:56
and actually helped bankroll a lot of the uh the money that you guys have been splashing
14:02
uh he has gone off to do his work with uh the church
14:07
and then uh Carlin uh the the gnomish tinkerer who was
14:14
providing support um he has returned to his home Forge but
14:19
says that uh if you need him and he's available to look him up and he's always
14:24
interested in opportunities to make some extra money
14:31
um as far as the rest of the Fallout uh there was a fair bit of questions from
14:39
the Water Deep guard uh the party left a trail of Destruction
14:45
wherever they went including burning down a warehouse and
14:50
uh yeah yeah we we got the story it was the
14:55
set set cultists yeah when we didn't do it we just happened we heard that this week
15:03
uh between uh the warehouse fire the attacks in broad daylight the death of
15:10
uh what was his name one of the uh
15:17
the temple uh uh higher-ups I have to find his name
15:26
uh but one of the temple higher reps one of the the higher priests had been assassinated
15:33
uh over the course of this adventure and then there was this knock down blood
15:39
everywhere fight on the docks involving some cultists in a very odd shaped uh
15:47
flesh Golem that ended with well partly ended with Hugo being
15:52
ripped into by this thing and then just talked into the the Water Deep Bay
15:59
uh which as I said you know Hugo happened to have a pouch of party gems
16:05
on him when he went down to the the cold I don't know why I don't know why you got to keep mentioning this
16:12
yeah it's been a year so I want to make sure that everyone remembers what they did
16:19
last time [Music]
16:24
so that that did become a thing you were all questioned by the guard but eventually well they they don't quite
16:31
trust you you seem like a bunch of troubles um there was enough evidence that you
16:37
you weren't deliberately tormenting or causing trouble and you were let off
16:44
more or less with a you know weird situation hope it doesn't become a habit
16:55
and then um you actually did your exploits did make uh effectively
17:04
the newspaper for for several days um and I believe that Hugo had sent some
17:10
letters so Matt do you wish to tell them what those letters
17:17
say I I would guess that would depend on on what the uh what the church uh wanted to
17:24
uh uh put out no no the letters had to be written before you guys had your your
17:29
fight well the the I mean the the letters essentially gave uh proof of what was
17:38
going on with the the Church of set and um it uh implored the different uh
17:46
purchase to to invest more and uh into this into this plight
17:53
um the detailed cesse and his his uh his heroics and his uh
18:00
contributions to the to the fight it had to do with uh uh
18:08
Howard's characters uh uh you know when you win and his his uh his exploits and
18:17
two to Aaron's exploits uh in the uncovering of the the plight of set and
18:23
it was uh uh giving all of his uh how do we say conspiracy theory you know
18:30
connections between everything and uh you know where everything was
18:35
headed and and what he thought was uh to be the outcome
18:42
um so I don't know what all they would they would uh uh certainly put out I don't I don't have it in front of me I
18:48
just kind of wanted to remind you that that was going on it is included in mentioned in the the
18:56
newspaper stories as crackpot Theory right that's what I assume that's what I
19:02
assumed you're treated with all the respect of a Reddit thread yeah exactly exactly and I
19:09
assume that's what that with a yeah I assume that was the case of course of course
19:17
he was no longer on the Earthly plane yes exactly but I I didn't know how much
19:25
mention was given to cese about what was going on or or or or whatnot because that was probably the biggest one well I
19:31
thought you had said that you had sent them copies of the letter yeah oh I I don't know I'd have to look it up
19:38
yeah originally it was going to be that you had sent them a copy of of the letter as well oh yeah yeah okay okay
19:45
so so yeah uh Brad you're so say uh gets a copy of a letter from from Hugo uh
19:52
detailing the information that he sent to uh your church and to the Church of mystra and to your church uh Aaron uh
20:00
having to do with the exploits of what's going on below the uh you know below ground and uh you're right and water
20:07
deep and and how badly he thinks it's going to go and it had some very odd
20:15
um um insightful things that maybe even you guys didn't even uh see
20:23
um that you could almost see the string board yeah yeah you can see the me the mean guy going like this
20:31
beta silver or whatever it is right so so that's that's the extent of that
20:36
of Hugo reaching out beyond the grave for you guys [Laughter]
20:43
and after about a month of rest and relaxation each one of you have a a
20:49
letter delivered by hand by a child Courier
20:56
um and cracking open the seal you see it as a relatively brief note from Sarah
21:02
Johnson he is reaching out to each of you saying
21:07
his condolences for the loss of Hugo but the mark shift of Commerce must ever go
21:13
forward I have a job for you if you're interested the beating is in three days at the
21:21
Pepper Ridge Farm about it's about an hour south of Water Deep
21:27
outside of the gates outside of the city walls um where you'll be meeting with a young
21:34
Elvis rafontaine who is seeking assistance that perhaps
21:41
you can provide okay trying to catch up with notes Here
21:50
I think you're the only one 's already left the the uh the note came from somebody
21:58
Johnson yeah Sarah Johnson s-e-r
22:05
it's there joro Johnson he's the guy who hired you originally at the Garden of
22:12
Heroes okay so um how does that relate to
22:21
thank you I don't earn my nose where is she
22:27
yeah the girl who ran the magic mechanical Guild or whatever he is he is
22:33
a uh to put it in modern terms he's a fixer he he works as a go-between you you
22:40
don't currently it's Layla Rye you don't currently have any jobs from her because you burned down all of her equipment and
22:47
she's busy uh recreating the the business
22:52
again as a lawful neutral Paladin I must mention that we did not in fact burn
22:59
down her property we were merely there with her property burnt down yeah that's
23:05
true absolutely I didn't burn anything oh my God
23:14
[Music] right and wrong you didn't kill anyone you were merely
23:21
present when they were killed right I don't know we did kill people I
23:32
died but we didn't learn anything [Laughter]
23:37
you know Hugo's not here to defend himself this is not fair
23:43
I would call on sese to defend me we really didn't burn anything down
23:49
that's not that was not our fault I know I'm just trying to get you good um no you guys are like independent
23:57
contractors with Layla and Magic mechanical but right now they are kind
24:02
of out of business pending renovations uh and uh gero Johnson had originally
24:10
introduced you to that job and is now offering to introduce you to another job
24:16
right so he's the one we met initially in the in the garden in the garden correct
24:22
I remember I have his name noted how many fires have you guys been
24:29
through because I sat through one of your sessions listening and there was a lot of fire
24:37
yeah well I guess uh Ted likes to use fire what can I say yeah Max
24:44
he's evil dude it's evil
24:58
so I'm assuming that you guys are going to attend is there anything that you're going to
25:04
do beforehand no I don't think so
25:10
I mean nothing in particular I had nothing particular planned
25:19
we're traveling about an hour which is it south of Waterloo yeah Pepper Ridge
25:27
do they have a farm
25:38
Farm is that it had been um basically a
25:44
crop and livestock farm and was taken over by the oldest son who returned from
25:52
life as an adventurer and he decided that uh the best way to make money was
25:57
to turn it into an in and dining establishment with some rooms for rent
26:04
uh making it a convenient place to do business outside of waterdeep and technically outside of the jurisdiction
26:10
of the 130 yards and also being convenient for those that did not want
26:16
or could not afford to pay for longer term uh
26:21
visitor passes visas basically and they make good crackers in cookies
26:28
uh you know you haven't tried them yet but you know for perhaps perhaps one
26:34
interesting thing is this old older son and and I think probably to win would be the one
26:40
that would know this the the older son that that left the adventuring lifestyle was a necromancer
26:46
oh and one one of the things that he does to help bring in money is the the
26:53
center of this this restaurant has a large pit is the description of it
27:00
and forfe and prior arrangement he will
27:05
populate that pit with various Undead or for even more he will see if he can
27:12
round up things like goblins or whatnot and and Corral them into this pit and then the
27:20
the paying party has the privilege of bumping them off oh that sounds so oh my
27:28
God what sport oh my God
27:33
exactly right he even has it rigged up so there's an old Millstone suspended on pulleys above
27:41
the pit so that if you're not the strong of arm type you can simply pull the lever drop
27:49
the millstone on whatever's under there and cashier my goodness
27:56
XP for sale kinda
28:06
it's also for entertainment there's bedding on the side of like you know how
28:11
how long will it take the the fighter to kill off the the goblins you know that kind of thing
28:21
it's it's always person on Monster they they don't they don't allow like human
28:26
on human Bloodsport or human on Elf or anything like that what about monstrous beings only
28:36
this kind of blurs the line don't they yeah depends on how they behave
28:48
so I'm hearing nothing so the the original party meet up at Pepper Ridge
28:55
Farms in the evening um you come in it's it's kind of a nice
29:02
place quite honestly it's a little bit remote but there's quite a few carriages that you recognize as being surely from
29:11
Water Deep they're too too nicely made Jason has polymorphism
29:18
um uh and uh you know it's doing good
29:24
business there's nothing in the pit today um and yeah you come in and
29:31
[Laughter]
29:36
you come in and there's the usual cast of uh people just coming out for an evening
29:43
out uh at a nicer restaurant there's adventurers there are shady looking
29:50
Nobles um as you come in a young woman
29:55
uh perhaps 19 to 20 ish quite quite Young by our standards but by wider deep
30:03
standards at a full adult um she has the look about her of someone
30:09
who has uh she is is accustomed to dealing with
30:14
people perhaps in a way that uh negotiations are difficult and political
30:23
he just has that hard eye look of someone who has been training for
30:30
dealing with people for the last decade uh which you you would clock especially
30:36
police essay as to your your perspective she reminds you
30:41
of a lot of uh young Nobles who are trained from basically about 10
30:48
to be successful Nobles and dealing with the political Intrigue and backfighting
30:56
to win you see her and you think um like Rich Merchant's daughter perhaps
31:02
someone who is used to dealing with trade dealing with negotiations perhaps
31:09
dealing with things that uh needs to go quietly through checkpoints
31:14
but definitely someone who is accustomed to negotiation and political aspects of
31:22
such things she does not appear to be particularly robust as a fighter with her is a an
31:32
Elvish Knight with a large field on his back he is
31:38
currently carrying a decent-sized chest uh that would be uh Galen
31:46
and the other characters
31:53
uh Mark well he's gone now uh Matt you are Matt's gone now too God
32:02
damn it what no I I was gonna give let Jason come in and
32:09
he's gone and then I look over and then you're gone like you were gonna what
32:15
I keep losing players oh no
32:24
a wizard and a uh well you know assumed to be a wizard he's wearing the robes
32:30
and whatnot he's a man of slight build probably yes yes
32:39
and uh a a priestess and a
32:44
uh dark-skinned armored Warrior uh come in and they are upgraded by this this
32:51
lady that I have described in something about it just kind of kind of gets your attention
32:57
you kind of listening a little bit but you're eating eating it's a simple fare you know as benefits someone of your
33:05
means uh Jason same thing you're you're you're eating a
33:12
slightly heartier meal having traded an afternoon of splitting wood at the end
33:18
uh for your meal have I met you you do see your backstory splitting the money
33:24
to have I met Jason today uh no not yet okay Jason did you see the
33:30
backstory about the the cash situation I did I did I've got okay yes
33:37
good afternoon splitting some wood to uh to buy an evening meal uh and and
33:44
because of your your ability with an ax you flew through it
33:50
um and and got a quite a hearty meal quite nice uh a whole loaf of uh dark
33:55
red some rich Beady stew
34:05
if it's Jason's character that's what I'm talking about if it's Jason's character he probably just stuck to
34:11
sausage and he didn't chew a lot if you know what I mean right just
34:27
you know whatever so she she leads the party back to a
34:33
table there aren't any private rooms but there are some that are further away than others
34:39
and sits and and gestures uh
34:44
the uh the the fighter with her is kind of standing at a basically a bodyguard
34:50
position holding this chest and she explains to you that uh
34:59
uh things have been afoot
35:04
that I have noticed so let me the problem with having notes is you
35:10
have to use it right yep
35:15
so she explains that uh she is is seeking the hiring of some
35:23
independent uh independent actors
35:29
she has a uh heard of you uh Sarah Johnson has
35:35
said that you can be trusted and that you are more than competent
35:40
in in matters of both Intrigue and action
35:46
trust is something that I have great difficulty relinquishing however
35:53
I I have been able to confirm that Sarah Johnson's opinion of you is at least
35:59
likely to be true um
36:05
by appearances you all seem to be reasonably capable and I'm willing to
36:11
put my trust in you um I am as you can tell
36:16
uh a a lady in the world and while I am a widow I do have
36:23
resources to to put to hiring skilled people
36:30
I have come here because of news of an unusual artifact of exceptional power
36:39
hold on
36:44
the eye of Israel sorry
36:51
um I cannot tell you yeah the eye of Israel
36:58
how do you spell that Federal i-t-r-a-l
37:08
uh and and I have received word that it is within the area
37:14
the problem is is that it has no classification it is an artifact that is quite
37:21
dangerous and must be kept out of the wrong hands
37:27
uh we have word that a group a cult if you will is also looking
37:35
to get it as well as worshipers of salt skeleton Israel
37:43
she she slides over a cloth wrapped object to the table
37:49
this is what we were able to recover from one of the people that we believe to be
37:55
an agent of this cult foreign
38:06
[Music]
38:29
uh as is uh Jason's character
38:34
Marcus so this uh eye of Israel or whatever yes what what is uh what are
38:40
the powers of this ion intro it is not entirely known but it is it is known to
38:47
have exceptionally powerful powers of divination
38:52
oh what [Laughter] what suddenly Howard wakes up
38:58
hold on but it is also exceptionally dangerous as as artifacts tends to be
39:07
I requested say again you said powers powers of what
39:14
if you're not part of the conversation you're sitting there eating yourself yeah
39:20
I can hear every word man taking notes
39:26
I hope that I can be I can rely upon you to assist me in this means while I am
39:35
not without money or Arcane ability I am one person
39:40
so what cult is it that you uh suspected over an item no one's bothered to open
39:47
it oh our uh the wedding cloth wrapped item across the table to
39:54
the party all right um to win looks rather sheepishly and then can I can I can I cut in there
40:03
yeah the sausage too all right there's a figure that darkens
40:09
and cast a shadow over the table he Stoops down beside yourself first he
40:15
Stoops down below the beam in the ceiling and you notice that his he does have to
40:22
stoop to get down below the beam and he puts his hand down on the table
40:27
and he grabs the the was it is it a picture of the item is that what it was
40:34
no no it's a cloth wrapped item no one has opened the cloth yet he puts his hand on the cloth wrapped item and opens
40:40
it up uh faunit is a uh it's a
40:46
Medallion uh and it's inscribed in on The Medallion is a serpent
40:55
and you don't even have to roll uh Brad knows that that is the symbol of set
41:02
tle upset I do believe I can help you I know that I am not but it is
41:09
effectively is an Unholy symbol so you actually feel a little nauseous
41:14
just having it out but I can tell you that I can help you
41:20
who are you why are you why are you over listing or
41:26
listening in on our conversation here yeah is this guy with you I am not with you
41:33
but I hope it's this conversation and I had the thought that I should be
41:40
here this evening sound like a communist to me
41:46
I do not know what this is you speak of but this is a woman what is this guy
41:53
what does he look like you know how's he dressed he's in a dark brown and black
42:00
and generally just sort of Blends into the background of the Shadows
42:05
yeah he said he was big yes he's he's very large uh
42:12
it's hard to describe him because his frame doesn't quite fit it's odd and his
42:19
uh his hair is all long and his beard is long and and uh his eyes his eyes are
42:26
strange sounds like a communist [Laughter]
42:33
who is this is this a Rasputin that is a very good explanation of what he might
42:39
look like and he has his hand on the item and he's looking at it he does have armor though
42:45
not not amongst robe that is correct and he looks at you he stares into your eyes through you
42:53
and he hands through and he and he puts his hand down to you he puts his hand out to you to hand you the item to look
42:59
at because you haven't looked at it yet he's the only one that's looked at it and he hands you the item
43:07
I know what it is it's a it's a set Medallion of some kind but
43:14
it may be I feel uncomfortable having this verse
43:20
in here you just gotta walked up and just grab the thing and I don't know who is this
43:27
guy he's been a very abortionable personality
43:38
very very large sword and puts it down next to the table and leans it up against the table
43:44
it's it stretches up above the table quite a bit do you mind if I see it
43:53
well I was gonna ask her what did you say your name was again
43:58
yeah you gotta stop talking every time Mike says her name you're like jinxing it
44:07
all right let's try one more time my character reveal
44:14
Fontaine I would ask kelsra where she got this medallion
44:21
off the Corpse of someone who uh We Believe has malicious intent with
44:26
relation to the eye everything that we've seen about them so
44:33
far has proven this assumption to be correct
44:39
as for you large man what what what do you bring that I should hire you
44:49
that's directed at you Matt hey you can speak now or are you like dramatically mulling over the question
44:56
that's correct [Laughter] besides stunning good looks
45:03
he just definitely he does not have good looks he has a very alarming sort of yeah
45:10
thought uh presence yes I
45:16
I heard your words and I felt the presence of the amulet
45:23
and I thought I should come over and offer my services to you
45:28
you felt the presence are you uh well you're clearly not a wizard
45:35
a holy Warrior of some sort I I hear the words of my God speaking to
45:42
me yes and who is your god the god of suffering
45:49
can you show your holy symbol at this point it's it's it's clearly down below
45:55
my my chin it's hanging down yes you want to tell them what it looks like it
46:00
is uh two hands that are clasped with uh with red binding
46:06
well that's kind of obvious yeah I was referring to what it was made of but oh I know it's a it's a rock it's
46:14
a rock that's had uh uh inscribed with uh very roughly but it's clearly in the
46:20
hand in the the figure of two hands like this right and some binding and some
46:26
some sort of red uh pigment in there right I I'll also
46:32
help Matt out by saying that this is a rock that looks like it was picked up off the side of the road and then scratch that with a dagger
46:39
until it had the holy symbol scratched into it and then you're not really sure how but
46:45
a hole was drilled into the top and then rough twine run through it and that's
46:51
what's hanging on his neck it is not metal it is a Street Rock
47:00
is that like an illmeter looking symbol right wasn't he the tortured God yeah
47:08
you got it I mean it's not raw
47:15
there's absolutely nothing sexy or pretty about it absolutely not
47:21
this it is the opposite it is the opposite of sexy
47:28
I have to use my mirror on this one I'm a makeover my God yeah he is he's
47:38
not dirty but he is a little rough
47:43
I guess we've gone full Beauty and the Beast have we let's
47:50
[Music]
47:55
go Ellsworth says uh she she uses some magic
48:00
and and approaches you and says may I touch you to me
48:07
yes oh you may She lays a hand on you and appears to be
48:14
casting a definition spell of some sort there's nothing to hide here
48:22
she removes her hand
48:27
Well you certainly seem capable but so many holes
48:33
would she say very well so many what she said so many holes holes okay I got you
48:41
I just stare at her stare down at her I guess I guess I look if you know what else objects
48:48
I I have no issue Mike can I tell what devonation spell
48:53
she guessed uh it was a combination of it started
48:59
off with like the tech Good and Evil but it was uh an unusual divination
49:05
spell that you believe was looking into his character and his background basically
49:11
like an object reading almost uh psychomancy that's it
49:16
it's not a spell that you're familiar with but you get the basics of what she was doing
49:21
hmm [Music] it was usually psychomancy works on
49:29
items not people is that Arcane or is that uh
49:36
I'm just letting you have it
49:42
she's not exactly trying to hide it after all okay well I'm I'm just trying to
49:50
understand the origins of the spell right it's not one that you're familiar
49:55
with or have heard of before okay
50:00
that even that Peaks his curiosity even more he's all driven by learning the uh
50:07
he's spelled now I have to figure out how that works all right
50:13
uh she looks to the the three of the the priority members and and said she does
50:18
not object if you don't he seems capable enough
50:26
to him looks at the Paladin yeah I don't know I mean you know I
50:31
don't know about just adding some guy walks up to the table exactly exactly we had some bad
50:39
experiences with uh guys at ulterior motives
50:45
fairly recently so it's a month ago you know I I'm not saying no I'm just
50:53
saying uh if she wants to hire him he can come along as muscle but
50:58
it is not your choice it is hers he starts [ __ ] up you know
51:05
it'll be problems it's a rough Paladin a bra
51:11
I'm neutral so I can go you know right right all you gotta do is give some
51:16
money to the poor yeah hahaha [Music]
51:23
unfortunately unfortunately Matt's character is the poor
51:30
[Music] I posted a picture in uh Magic
51:36
mechanical of one of my first thoughts of of what he might look like so if you guys wanna
51:42
peruse that okay
51:49
I think that that Victor shows you too well fed that's true that is true wait a
51:55
minute wait a minute I got another one I got another one
52:01
homeless Chic is what he's going for
52:08
that derelict Authority doesn't have any objections she she gestures to the guard behind her
52:14
who steps forward and she opens up the chest and she pulls out a pouch for each of
52:20
you placing it on the table uh and says this is
52:27
for upfront expenses and to ensure your focus on the job
52:35
opening it up I assume somebody's going to open it up
52:41
um I put my big this ham sized fist down there
52:49
because we never count money at the table uh you open up this pouch and see
52:56
uh it is a lot of gold
53:01
uh I will just say the number it's it's a combination of golden gems but basically it's a thousand gold pieces
53:08
per pouch wow this is the down payment
53:13
yes for expenses do we have to itemize
53:19
I know just put just put a thousand gold uh and then she turns to her her bodyguard and says I have one for you
53:26
too if you wish it that's the URL more
53:36
he's added attention but he's not said anything I do I do because I have no money
53:42
okay and I need the Monies
53:47
because I I was told that there would be another a Hugo
53:53
I have a pouch for him as well but he does not seem to be here anymore
54:03
the wind's kind of sad at that remark it doesn't say anything new so Jason you've
54:09
been wearing this conversation as well am I able to uh see the gold
54:19
uh you you kind of hear the shocks like how much is that
54:25
you hear a lot of coins being moved around
54:31
so I'm going to approach the table and say um you know not sure who this Hugo fellow
54:38
was but um I have been overhearing you uh mainly
54:43
because of that loud squeaky voice of whatever Brad's character is
54:48
um and I am I'm quite interested in
54:53
um possibly taking Hugo's place on uh whatever Endeavor needs to be
55:00
accomplished would you care to describe yourself for the party what they see walking up
55:07
yeah they see a uh large human about six foot three
55:13
220 pounds of muscle um carrying a large two-handed ax by his
55:22
side he's dwarfed by the guy who's [Laughter]
55:39
how tall is your character again back six it says six foot five
55:45
I don't know why oh wait six foot four it's about the same size I don't know what let's see
55:51
yeah where's that at
55:58
uh I think it's under uh uh biography yeah it's a six foot
56:05
freaking five oh no oh yeah
56:11
he's a [ __ ] Giant
56:16
yes but I will say to you guys as as you noticed his his features are very bony
56:25
very odd don't forget you also have pedia chroma what is it oh hideo Chrome
56:31
that's if they I looked into I looked into their eyes I especially Cece and I
56:36
he didn't really say anything but you will notice that his eyes are very strange yeah his eyes are very strange
56:43
you just said your eyes are strange you didn't say what about them so brown eye
56:48
in one blue eye oh very odd
56:53
it all makes every time he looks at you he just kind of makes you just kind of relax
56:59
yeah green and brown yeah
57:07
so anyway I um yeah yeah we overshadow we overshadowed
57:13
Jason [Laughter] anyway I guess
57:20
um offering my services to the group
57:28
yeah you're you're pretty stacked [Laughter]
57:36
he's got a lot of muscle on him a lot of muscle and a
57:42
big great ax where are you guys at what are you doing there
57:50
are you looking at him it's just the description
58:01
if we are chasing after this evil I suggest we
58:08
hire more muscle bring him along as well
58:15
what do you say oh is this is this guy speaking for us now
58:22
he's the leader in a party like 90 seconds and he's already hiring folks I
58:30
will say this for the homeless night he has force of personality see that
58:38
I look at I look at the the lady who's handing out the gold I suggest we hired
58:44
him yes we we we [Laughter]
58:51
go ahead and make a Charisma check that persuasion okay unless you're doing
58:57
it as a performance but persuasion I got you uh
59:06
uh I gotta find it oh uh Mike I didn't do my uh Delio I
59:13
gotta roll my 2d20 yeah yes it's important perception
59:23
no he's not doing perception he's doing magic do I get to do it
59:29
[Music] so you'll note those down yep
59:35
yep no it's just a straight roll that somebody's giving you health action okay Jason's character you do get to you do
59:43
get to add your proficiency if you have it right I can't even read that
59:50
it's kind of the 25th and that's my anvil he rolled in that 20.
59:57
why is this even possible you can be wrong give me rolling D6 he's
1:00:04
very compelling do you want me roll a D6 is it because I'm too afraid
1:00:13
it's more uh yeah yeah I got it I got standard d d rules
1:00:23
it screws up other mechanics that I want to use so I don't use it right
1:00:29
so um yeah you like do you just have this this force of
1:00:34
personality that comes through despite looking like horseshit right
1:00:43
and you know as he as he talks you you see the sense of what he's saying that
1:00:49
there's if nothing else there's someone else to stand behind
1:00:55
when the arrows are coming in right right because Dwayne and I are small we're not big people right right
1:01:04
foreign
1:01:19
and I put it down the table and I look around for the pitcher to fill it up
1:01:25
so it is it is done we shall go together
1:01:32
what so uh
1:01:40
so is it uh Helen hellfang is that is that Matt's character I am yes he hasn't
1:01:49
given his name yet yeah okay anyway Matt's care Matt's character is accepted for the group
1:01:55
he's just kind of wedged his way in as it were no name just got it yeah yeah
1:02:03
oh Rasputin was a very good Edge it was a very good description yes
1:02:11
other than um Matt's character as I look around the table what what's the characteristics of
1:02:17
the individuals I'm seeing let's just go off in order when you want
1:02:24
to describe what he sees the twins uh is it very small in stature
1:02:29
not exceptionally small but just it's you know a slight slight build for a
1:02:35
human uh male uh he's he's reasonably good looking uh Sharp Dressed
1:02:42
um everything's neat and tidy with him and you can see he's kind of obviously a
1:02:48
very scholarly kind of person he's got books and pins about him
1:02:54
um he also is wearing um the Mages robe and has a utility belt
1:03:01
on him with numbers of things and ready access that suggests that he's a
1:03:07
spellcaster um he has a uh Hawk that sits on his
1:03:12
shoulder almost all the time and uh when he speaks he's he's fairly
1:03:19
soft and and plain spoken um not a very uh boisterous kind of guy
1:03:27
and he's kind of he's a little bit Meek and and hesitant which is why he keeps
1:03:33
looking to the cleric and the Paladin like what's going on here
1:03:41
all right all right so Amaco um is wearing this uh red and gold
1:03:49
outfit um that's very form-fitting um but she has a very large like symbol
1:03:57
of with the head of of uh soon on her chest which is the one with the the
1:04:05
goddess with the red hair so it's it's very obvious that she's got
1:04:11
this this symbol of soon on her uh right right where so everybody has to look toward
1:04:18
her breast area anyway so um did it just work out that way yes it was
1:04:26
it was intentional so um she's a very very attractive young
1:04:33
woman with a very very large
1:04:38
very big air very very big pearly brown hair and uh 80s 90s here
1:04:47
she she looks um uh the best way that I could describe it
1:04:54
is that she looks like she's uh you know a kind of exotic in that she's
1:05:00
um she looks like she's uh I guess in our our terminology Asian and
1:05:07
white uh so she has kind of a very very uh unique look about her uh but yeah so
1:05:14
she's wearing this red out red and gold outfit with this thing right there on her chest and
1:05:20
um she uh is uh yeah she's about wait I would say her
1:05:27
and doing are about probably the same size and height I mean she's not a large
1:05:33
woman she's uh she's about average height for a female um but she's rather
1:05:40
the small curves that she does have she does like to show them off you know as a
1:05:46
as a cleric of soon um and uh yeah voice Wise It's I would I
1:05:54
would say her voice is not particularly high or low but uh definitely she doesn't have any
1:06:02
issues with getting loud if need be foreign
1:06:18
next up would be Galen
1:06:28
a really good looking uh health uh fighter I have uh you know chainmail
1:06:36
on I have a long sword I have a really sweet Shield that you're all looking at
1:06:41
that's really
1:06:48
and when you and when you look at the shield it looks back at you oh God I
1:06:54
don't know if I want to look at your Shield then he's got the stripes like like carved into the side of his head
1:07:04
his hat on Sideways is your Shield like a Elven God or is it
1:07:12
just like somebody's head or what deal with your Shield with this it's
1:07:21
oh I see but it but it is
1:07:27
that is great
1:07:32
um as the as The Bodyguard of of this yeah
1:07:38
she's been serving as The Bodyguard for this evening and uh that was uh this
1:07:45
Fontaine turned to him with a pouch and said that uh there's a place for him if he wants it
1:07:51
and he accepted so I had a question as as elves go is he
1:07:59
like a like a young looking Elf or a middle-aged show for
1:08:04
an older Elf or what would see she look like in terms
1:08:10
who else actually is so uh but I am a I would say I'm probably
1:08:17
on the a little bit of the younger side for now um I'm a Wanderer I'm wandering you know
1:08:26
kind of exploring it's not his run sprigger becoming a better fighter he is he is a
1:08:34
young soul he will do yes very nicely
1:08:42
listen I'm still using the mirror on you buddy we haven't gotten away from that
1:08:50
I said I'm also six of anybody cares oh my God what is it with all these apologies
1:09:08
hey I'm just reading the sheet they were giving me okay listen we're like the tiny people yeah
1:09:19
we're like the little people of this party and then that we're like dwarfed by these this Rasputin looking dude
1:09:26
Gigantor elf and then this office hell dude uh
1:09:36
I guess I guess perhaps complaints about not enough meat Shields was was heard loud and clear yeah
1:09:44
[Laughter] uh
1:09:54
[Laughter]
1:10:04
let's say again Mike you broke up I I said uh Elmore was finished and
1:10:10
you're next on my Discord list so are you gonna have anything in your description like your name or anything
1:10:16
like that yeah yeah uh my name is Marcus Marcus Maximus
1:10:22
um look I'm not gonna spell everything about me but I I can let them know that
1:10:28
um I I was a blacksmith um or I am a blacksmith by trade but a fighter by desire and necessity
1:10:36
and um recently come into some Misfortune and
1:10:42
um I am definitely looking to replenish my coin purse um and happy why are your characters
1:10:48
always broke [Laughter]
1:10:58
[Music] [Laughter] yeah yeah
1:11:07
my friend
1:11:14
no wait a second uh where do you get Brad's description
1:11:19
no not yet he's he's going down his list yeah okay I'm gonna major up to
1:11:26
everybody it's white he's got to get out his ways
1:11:32
to understand and synthon was a wealthy Paladin yeah
1:11:39
how long has he last yeah well it is
1:11:48
crazy of poverty means that he's less likely to be targeted
1:11:59
um for for myself I will describe uh this Fontaine
1:12:05
as I said she's a young woman uh she has dark hair but she is wearing
1:12:11
a hood you know a nicely done Hood she's
1:12:16
wearing um rather Rich clothing uh you're not quite sure because none of
1:12:24
you are nobles other than CEST day but that's a different country whether she is uh
1:12:31
dressed as a like a lower Noble or a higher level like
1:12:36
Merchant House Scion kind of a thing but it's very nice clothing not something
1:12:42
that you would see in just anybody um she has various decorations she has a
1:12:48
gold gold collar a choker on her neck as a an accessory hanging down is a little
1:12:56
pendant does it have a loop on it does it have a loop yeah you know where
1:13:02
you detach it never mind is it
1:13:08
you know what color oh oh yeah that was good that was good
1:13:15
that was good she's got a little pendant of a Sunburst
1:13:22
but it's not a holistic bull it's just an accessory um
1:13:27
and uh that's what you see from her she's she's otherwise
1:13:32
uh seems like a a normal like very young woman basically
1:13:38
I I do want to ask her uh what who is this you'll represent
1:13:44
that you wish us to I represent myself
1:13:50
I I have means as as I mentioned my I am a widow
1:13:55
so I have financial means as well as Arcane means of my own
1:14:02
and it came to my attention that this eye would be quite dangerous in the wrong
1:14:07
hands so I ask you again who do you represent
1:14:13
what is your name I say again myself yourself I see
1:14:19
hey can I mention this guy is not with us okay
1:14:26
he's he's not with us so right right his questions shouldn't reflect on us as
1:14:32
all I'm saying were you gonna let it sit at that matter
1:14:39
are you gonna keep pushing I I I wish to know what you
1:14:45
where your faith lies my child
1:14:50
my faith is my own business I I choose not to wear it around like a
1:14:56
stone yes where when your God speaks to you in his
1:15:02
own voice then you will know what your plan is for your life
1:15:08
tell me who do you follow my child
1:15:13
I think that that has nothing to do with it he does it does because you we recover
1:15:21
this item and where does it go
1:15:26
it those were a pouch of a thousand gold pieces per person pays no
1:15:36
I'm missing something hold on I can't find it
1:15:46
wasn't there a thing where he can chime in I chime in and I say uh I need not
1:15:51
such questions answered and happy to do the job
1:15:58
the presence of Good and Evil and all that
1:16:03
uh-oh yeah you're gonna cast the spell it in the open
1:16:09
absolutely that's that's what I just said where is your where does your faith lie my child I I will say that that's
1:16:16
usually considered exceptionally rude yeah um I I don't know that I need to like
1:16:24
make an introduction for this character or not but that's also like oh so you're single
1:16:32
yeah yeah exactly that's exactly who this is a pickup line yes I'm also going
1:16:39
to chime in where I'm in that for an extra 200 gold I'd be happy to get rid of this guy for you
1:16:47
spell Matt well I thought he could I thought he could innately sense the presence of
1:16:53
Good and Evil it's still magic uh and I don't know that paladins get
1:17:00
in eight League since Good and Evil I thought well yeah no we have uh yeah
1:17:07
we have a like a uh yeah yeah there's a Divine snack
1:17:14
and yeah it it they have to focus on it yeah
1:17:22
there we go as a as an action he could detect good and evil
1:17:32
uh location of any Celestial fiend Undead blah blah blah
1:17:39
blah blah blah yeah I think you since you put it there you know
1:17:44
and I just I just do that as a as a what is your faith live my child
1:17:51
I need to see some details on this so this is a within range yeah it's within
1:17:58
[Music] um go ahead and burn your use
1:18:03
um let me find it again uh
1:18:12
Mike I you you do your own thing but I've always said that it because it's an action because they have to concentrate
1:18:17
and maybe hold their holy symbol and and so forth yeah
1:18:23
well I got it right here so you know where does their faith live right right where does your faith lie my child yeah
1:18:30
but basically Matt what you're doing is is you're doing the Street Preacher bit yeah exactly
1:18:37
yes I that is exactly what he's doing where does your face when he says where
1:18:43
does your face my my child or your use yeah okay so that's why I'm trying to
1:18:49
find it uh what is that attribute that's not attributes what is it
1:18:55
it's an active ability under features features there we go
1:19:01
uh
1:19:09
uh this is really aggravating
1:19:20
I thought it would be under Spellbook it's not a spell
1:19:25
says he hasn't introduced himself yet has he not yet oh Divine sense there we go
1:19:34
Rasputin kind of took over again yeah
1:19:39
I still don't know how to do it okay wait oh there we go I can just click it
1:19:44
and usability there we go okay all right so with a 60-foot range you
1:19:51
pick up quite a bit of evil in the this this end but I'm looking right at here
1:19:59
huh I'm looking right at her it's a range you detect everything within 60 feet okay I figured you could
1:20:06
like like like night vision goggles you know it's not that exact all right well he's
1:20:14
not gonna do it anyway yeah you sense anything affected by it
1:20:20
uh detect Undead what did I say wait wait wait wait wait
1:20:26
wait wait wait wait wait you detect Undead I'm reading the description I'm telling you what you said okay
1:20:33
go ahead I was like to be like [Laughter]
1:20:39
okay now that said you do detect Undead in the basement oh [ __ ] oh boy oh [ __ ]
1:20:46
all right all right all right I'm gonna remain calm and I'm just gonna come um and look
1:20:53
around two of the patrons are evil um it in that uh you know they cut your
1:20:59
throat for a good deal okay but not her nah you don't get anything from her all
1:21:06
right I put my hand on her shoulder and I say I apologize my child
1:21:12
it's forgiven this time but remove your hand before I have it removed but but
1:21:18
there's much that troubles here and I look around oh yes yes and I looked down you say
1:21:25
there was it was in the basement yeah yeah that's quite a bit and I
1:21:30
looked down I look down at the floor
1:21:36
and I just I remember I remained I remain looking down at the floor
1:21:45
and I take my hands off the table [Music]
1:21:52
okay yes is uh as a beer right uh
1:22:00
I look I'm looking around the room by the way just go ahead keep going
1:22:05
okay so he's got the gold pupils and azimir
1:22:12
angel it's like a generality
1:22:17
yeah didn't you have uh as in your character horns no he had uh
1:22:24
a ganasi oh all right yeah the the face
1:22:30
it the face of ganasi yeah it's it's it's I mean I don't know it's the kind of a situation yeah right
1:22:38
and um so his pupils
1:22:45
I would just golden eyebrows or whatever and so his uh his skin is tanned right
1:22:52
those are golden tan to it that just comes along with being and has a mirror whatever I would pronounce that uh he's
1:22:59
got a short blonde cropped hair um he has a sort of distinctive tattoo
1:23:05
under his left eye it's that uh
1:23:15
you know so it's still hiding what religion he is and then
1:23:21
um uh he's tall um six two
1:23:27
um fairly well built but lean right not uh not thick muscle but lean muscle and
1:23:35
um did not have some fat on him right his bone skinny
1:23:46
be confident um does have sort of an aristocratic sort
1:23:52
of disdain for you know uh maybe not the stain but uh
1:23:58
lack of interest in the meanderings of the you know
1:24:03
right you know sort of their what he views is their sort of backward ways or whatever but
1:24:10
um uh it's got a hammer Warhammer
1:24:24
your audio is going out Brad I think that's about it I think that's about it
1:24:31
um um Brad I had a question for you is your is your little um is it your cousin
1:24:37
that's with you oh remember he got burnt oh my God he
1:24:44
didn't die I think we stopped it from dying right yeah that's right
1:24:53
yeah he got burned up right and we got caught inside the building when right so like
1:25:02
we got him out and he we took him to a Healer but I mean it's not like he's
1:25:07
magically back to his self together right and so there's some questions restoration
1:25:15
um well no we went down some right we went down some road with that yeah the deal was uh he was going to
1:25:23
take time to heal or whatever so he wouldn't be traveling with us
1:25:28
you know he'll be back at the base yeah it's only been a month tomorrow
1:25:36
that was you know that was my understanding of what the care we got him in and
1:25:42
um that kind of thing yeah
1:25:48
he's a little uh since he's a little you know not very flighty and not real
1:25:54
emotional uh kind of just by the Numbers kind of thing you know what I mean like I think
1:26:00
that's got to be covered a little Analytics [Laughter]
1:26:07
but he doesn't like to suffer fools either so I will say that right
1:26:13
so so the money has been handed over and she assures you that
1:26:19
if we can complete this successfully there's another bag for each of you
1:26:28
well I've assume that we have no issues yeah I know if it helped leads us to
1:26:34
more set folks or if it keeps stuff out of the hands and set folks then you know
1:26:39
that's that's the Clarion call for Cessna he's he's all about right
1:26:47
yeah all right I guess Matt's like walking around the restaurant downstairs
1:26:57
freaked out yeah just just to clarify how much how
1:27:02
much is the advance payment a thousands old into the group
1:27:09
no it's first person per person
1:27:14
um would you be able to add that for me uh sure
1:27:20
thank you
1:27:28
yeah for expenses oh thank you
1:27:38
and I can tell you this
1:27:46
I know that there are some rumors that the eye has surfaced somewhere in the city
1:27:51
I believe that it is most likely to be found
1:28:02
in the trades award which if you didn't know the trades Ward is decidedly the low end of Water Deep it
1:28:11
is uh the impoverished area
1:28:20
we have a map of Water Deep I I have a map of the trades and Ward
1:28:27
that I will put up uh but yeah
1:28:32
we have not we have nine maps of water day because it's that freaking big yeah yes it is
1:28:45
oh there you go
1:28:53
I am not familiar with uh Water Deep are others
1:29:10
two wins a watered avian yeah he has the card carrying membership thingy okay
1:29:16
silver he's got the Silver version right
1:29:24
somewhere
1:29:34
um you should be careful in your search as I've already mentioned uh there is this cult
1:29:42
and others searching for the eye for a noble ends the cold I'm sure will stop at nothing
1:29:50
in addition uh we believe that there are is a group called The Watchers of its
1:29:55
role seeking the eye or some ritual purpose
1:30:01
related to their calls I I know not what exactly I believe it's a misguided property
1:30:08
about causing the end of the world I know a little about them otherwise
1:30:14
this is very important though others may be seeking the eye
1:30:20
as I said it has powerful divining Magic uh others would seek to use it for their
1:30:28
own Financial gains or other ends uh I I do not wish it to be used in such
1:30:34
a way I wish it to be locked away and studied so that it may
1:30:39
not do Mischief in the world
1:30:47
an opportunity for me to study it are you asking her if she would let you
1:30:53
study it we can discuss that once it's in hand
1:31:03
I I won't rule it out but it's premature to divide the spoils
1:31:09
at this point
1:31:17
if you wish to stay here tonight as it is is later I can arrange for some rooms for you
1:31:25
otherwise I I will be waiting in the crown District
1:31:31
and she hands you a note to win it's got her an address on it
1:31:38
um
1:31:44
no telephones please uh return the I here or if you
1:31:52
have issues that you think that I might be able to assist with
1:31:57
in some other way please feel free to call I'm always willing to
1:32:03
put my best foot forward for those that are willing to do the same for me
1:32:09
is she looking at the wind the whole time yeah she's speaking to it so
1:32:14
dude [Laughter] he's not a meat Mountain like the rest
1:32:22
of you guys right I thought I was going to be the only one
1:32:29
here I'm uh clearly uh all right he tells her that uh we'll uh we'll
1:32:36
contact her in the city if need be but otherwise we'll meet back here I think she's more impressed by the uh the
1:32:42
personality of the person or as I said you can get wait a minute word to be at that location
1:32:47
very good
1:32:53
no magic squirrel no magic squirrel I'm not I didn't even
1:33:00
order cheese and wine yeah that's right cheap
1:33:08
uh you can get your own damn cheese and
1:33:14
wine [Laughter]
1:33:20
whether he knows much about the uh I think there was two groups looking for him one was the Colts and then yeah
1:33:27
there's the the Watchers of its role is one cult and then another is uh
1:33:34
apparently the the set cult yeah okay I'm gonna ask uh do and does
1:33:40
he does he know anything about either one groups having all right
1:33:46
does do I know anything about the Watchers and then he he obviously deflects anything about
1:33:52
um called the Set uh
1:33:57
because I'm sure he can talk way more about it than yeah perhaps not in balance for the
1:34:05
Watchers you could roll either an Arcana or a history check
1:34:13
oh I I guess I should do this too since I'm uh yeah yeah I I just figured you've
1:34:19
wandered away you've been like walking back and forth in the background Matt yeah you're good just like staring at
1:34:24
the floor with some sort of uh I'm I'm listening I'm listening I'm listening to
1:34:29
the other voices [Laughter] you said you said history or which
1:34:39
why am I not looking at the right screen well it's the same role
1:34:50
oh there I am okay all right so on a 15
1:34:57
um you know very little about them they're a pretty small cult
1:35:02
um said to worship a being known as the salt skeleton
1:35:09
and their goal is literally to bring about the end of the world
1:35:16
they make the rulers of what's left can I can I synergize off of what he
1:35:23
said to uh to roll advantage is anyone giving you health action
1:35:30
I do believe uh Darwin I can expound upon your uh knowledge
1:35:40
you can roll the same thing history or Arcana but you don't get Advantage if no one's
1:35:46
giving you a health action okay I I look at Derwin and I say
1:35:52
uh I do believe I have had similar knowledge and I wish to expand upon what you hear
1:36:00
I've said uh sure I I can compare notes with you
1:36:07
and I roll Advantage I'm trying to I'm trying to role play yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm just saying you're
1:36:15
asking for the high five oh my God look at that no no I cannot do anything I I do
1:36:22
believe I am a blank slate what in the world
1:36:33
he starts expanding on some like conspiracy theorists like out of left
1:36:39
field Fox News [ __ ] foreign
1:36:51
about like the entomology of it the the regions that they have come from the
1:36:57
distinctive smell that they have the longer he goes the more you're like
1:37:05
he is so wrong that is awesome I love that I
1:37:12
love that I will say I love that one at exactly the right time
1:37:18
yeah yeah he did yeah he did
1:37:32
we set up a meeting time and location in the morning
1:37:38
and let's get underway um
1:37:43
I I think I I'm gonna use some divination magic here
1:37:49
all right what are you going for what are you doing are you like again in
1:37:54
the pub you're going to start casting spells um
1:38:01
well this this particular spell takes a long time to cast so uh
1:38:07
I will probably wait until we get into a quiet place
1:38:13
like out of the room had to be sure
1:38:20
I need to find a better way that can pull up the character sheet because you actually you don't have our actors on
1:38:25
the screen so we can't really
1:38:38
uh let's just do it this way I don't see them on the actors tab
1:38:44
hang on you don't see your character under the actors
1:38:50
let me see mine but am I supposed to see others also no the others are other people's
1:38:56
character well I'll tell you these people see I'm not necessarily access them
1:39:04
hold on a second hey Jim I think he went out the garage door
1:39:20
easily accessible here actually I stand corrected the spell is
1:39:26
not inappropriate until I get much closer to making a decision say that again Howard I said the Spell's
1:39:33
not any good unless I'm closer to making a decision um I have to be within 30 minutes of making money so
1:39:41
step outside so uh I guess the party is indicating
1:39:47
that they would like some rooms so she gets up and and goes to the uh
1:39:52
the bar to arrange for some rooms
1:39:58
escorting back to where she's going no that's not necessary I have a
1:40:04
companion who's waiting for me okay oh the the contract as a bodyguard is
1:40:12
complete thank you all right
1:40:19
uh she hands the the party she slides over uh let's see
1:40:27
Four Keys and says apologies some of you will have
1:40:33
to double up as uh the end is is quite full for the evening it's rather late
1:40:38
but I was able to secure four private rooms you'll have to divvy up as you see I'm
1:40:45
not rumored with Matt I'm doing it hey fngs fngs are in a room to themselves
1:40:51
right they're the new guys
1:41:00

1:41:14
one bid yeah I do not my bad not my best
1:41:25
there is much suffering that I will take on but not this this no
1:41:31
as far as weather goes right your Northern Coastal
1:41:37
uh there's a lot of rain uh even during the summer but it's pleasantly warm
1:41:44
um but not hot is that a lot of racist that live out in the country nearby
1:41:51

1:41:57

1:52:02
nope it's still black for me yeah
1:52:07
I turned off love of War turned on global illumination
1:52:15
but the map if you had Fargo war on then the map is not revealed for us
1:52:22
because this even after you remove fog of War it doesn't reveal the entire map and
1:52:28
someone who's gone across you know if there's a way to remove it
1:52:33
um put a token on the board temporarily and uh you know particularly the party token
1:52:40
and then because there's no walls we should be able to see everything and you can remove the party together
1:52:58
I hate computers
1:53:04
now I can see can everyone else see no no yeah see that's why there's a party
1:53:10
token yeah everyone has controls the token
1:53:16
I see it yeah but we're in a different spot yeah I'm just dropping tokens in so that
1:53:21
you guys can see okay I got you yeah but I mean my token I lost
1:53:27
visibility disability yeah okay this is what happens when you
1:53:34
don't uh practice it for a year
1:53:40
better solve for a minute and I zoomed in and it went away yeah hold on
1:53:55
right now
1:54:01
no damn no no yeah yeah yeah
1:54:12
all right technical difficulties I'm just gonna drop everybody's hope
1:54:19
just so that you can see
1:54:28
whoa yeah that's a big token yeah
1:54:34
it's the image that Jason provided yeah well no the problem is it's a two
1:54:39
by two his character is taking up four squares
1:54:46
rather than one I know he's big but I don't think it's quite that big I think the size is appropriate for my greatness
1:54:52
yeah it's his ego it's his ego no this is
1:55:00
which one's uh [ __ ]
1:55:09
just called him cuckold [Laughter]
1:55:18
all right so this is this is literally just here it's a reference map so I'm not gonna be running encounters on it
1:55:24
Roger that so you were told basically that it's it's believed to be somewhere in the
1:55:31
trades Ward they're not sure she's not sure where uh and she's asking you to investigate
1:55:37
and find it and also prevent it from falling into the hands of these two cults
1:55:42
nice or anyone else that might be interested
1:55:52
well we should start in virgin Square I'm sure uh
1:55:58
thoughts are whatever is familiar with this Square
1:56:07
so what we're going to do mechanic wise is you guys can decide to look for
1:56:14
rumors basically do some investigation so each attempt is five hours you can
1:56:21
split up and get more attempts but that might bring the attention of the cult on someone who's by themselves
1:56:30
what are we splitting at least two groups um you could also if the investigation can be a couple different
1:56:35
ways you can like be public About It by like going to bars and buying drinks and asking around or you can try and go like
1:56:43
the Pei route and quietly investigate
1:56:51
is the success of this based on a Charisma role or
1:56:56
it is okay so I'm gonna I have to pair up with someone who's got a good way I should
1:57:03
say Brad it depends on the type so if you're doing like an E.I sleuthing
1:57:09
it's intelligence okay um so
1:57:15
who do we have I have high Charisma I'm guessing Rasputin does too right he's a
1:57:22
paladin right I I uh yes I I do yes
1:57:28
okay and who else has uh anybody else have a high charisma
1:57:34
well and minus one and I literally mean negative so yeah I
1:57:40
do not have negative Charisma I have a Charisma yes so wait a second what about the beauty
1:57:47
queen over there [Laughter]
1:57:53
um I have a 13 in my for my Charisma um this isn't the barge she has not uh
1:58:02
asserted herself in this uh in this matter
1:58:07
so maybe we pair up uh it I Mika was one of the paladins and then
1:58:16
what was yours Howard the wind what was your charisma uh well more intelligence depends on how
1:58:23
you're going to go about it yeah I I would probably be better off doing
1:58:29
investigation okay right all right so why don't you take the elf
1:58:36
might not suggest a different path sure go ahead um
1:58:41
now is when I think some divination magic might be able to help guide us as to
1:58:48
the path that we should take if we can agree on a
1:58:55
an action that will happen over the next 30 minutes
1:59:00
I can Divine over whether or not that action will yield positive or negative results
1:59:07
if this action is to listen to the Gods I I I agree with this yes
1:59:16
so would the action be something like um or talk to somebody who knows where the
1:59:24
I is it's any course of action you want to
1:59:29
to propose I can then Divine whether or not that course of action would be positive or
1:59:37
negative or both positive and negative or
1:59:43
it could be how would you form that question then is this too Neil at the uh at the uh at
1:59:53
the the is this to Neil and asked to the the the the goddess of uh Mysteries
2:00:01
us
2:00:07
so this is the Demand right Excuse Me Oh you mean the goddess of
2:00:13
mysteries the goddess of mystery I thought you said miseries no no that uh
2:00:18
Uh Russian accent that throws me off that is that is true I uh
2:00:25
I do not speak this language yeah
2:00:32
so this this is divination magic and this is using magic to Divine whether or
2:00:40
not a coercive action is going to yield so this is to ask our mistress to help us in our in our Quest yes
2:00:52
are you like not a bright Paladin uh
2:00:58
listen because God hasn't beat himself my God my God speaks to not the bright
2:01:05
Paladin yes well listen when you have when you
2:01:12
have to spend every day beating yourself you're not the right now
2:01:17
oh my God they they like cut to the quick on this guy I tell you
2:01:24
so Howard how would you how would you it doesn't have to be the final guess but
2:01:30
how would you initially think to frame that question well so if we if we propose that uh we
2:01:37
are going to search in a particular Ward and use a particular methodology
2:01:42
whether that's you know trying to ask around in taverns or you know we would
2:01:49
have to propose a particular course of action in this intent upon setting upon that course of
2:01:55
action and then we'll use the Divination magic to see if
2:02:01
we think it's if that course of action is going to be positive or negative
2:02:07
so go ahead why don't we propose then that the course of action is that we
2:02:15
um ask around for any clues on the location of the eye the next half hour
2:02:21
um we could either do that well it takes about five hours to to complete a
2:02:27
whether you do it as a a bar crawl kind of a thing where you're trying to buy
2:02:32
information or whether you're doing it like private eye investigation the time
2:02:39
is the same it's five hours yeah what do we see which one of those
2:02:45
methods is more is uh I mean we could try we could try asking about the success of one of those
2:02:51
methods and see what that's like and then try the other if it's not if we don't if it doesn't before it's not forecasted as being successful
2:03:00
what are benefits what about what about we split up one
2:03:08
half of the group does the tavern crawl and the other half
2:03:13
of the group follows Us From a Distance like they're investigating us waiting to see if we pick up any sales
2:03:20
well I think what we're what we're trying to do right now so we know there's two different ways we can investigate that's right one is the pub
2:03:27
crawl we're calling it the other one is the Magnum PI or whatever so uh
2:03:33
what Howard's saying is that we can he can use the Divination spell to figure out
2:03:39
if one of those actions would be likely to lead us to a clue to the but the way
2:03:46
I'd like to frame it is to make sure we're asking the question
2:03:51
to find the location of the eye you know yeah Clues to the location of the eye
2:03:58
because if we leave it half ended like that anything could be a clue to the location
2:04:04
you know guy says go look on the east side of town that's a clue to the location if it's actually on the east
2:04:10
side of town we wouldn't even know it you know what I mean so uh and what what feature are you using
2:04:17
for this uh Howard so
2:04:23
so does that sound about right Howard so yeah
2:04:29
um I don't actually ask it a question it's so I'm not actually posing a question
2:04:35
um I'm actually uh if we have a plan
2:04:41
okay I will agree then based upon our proposed actions and the
2:04:46
the augury spell will then tell us whether it's going to be good results bad results both good and
2:04:53
bad or it could be neutral okay well then
2:04:58
let's let's do our plan you know sort of like what Elmore was talking about we have I don't know about having people
2:05:05
follow us to see if we pick up a trail because I think we can do that without you know having a separate team do that
2:05:11
and you know we'll divide up a couple of folks we'll go with the paladins with
2:05:17
their High uh Charisma right and do the pub crawl thing and then the smartypants the nerdy
2:05:24
guys will will go do their you know undercover work so we'll have you know
2:05:29
three or four teams out doing two different methods at the end of the five hours we can meet
2:05:35
up and compare notes and see if we found anything useful does that sound yeah reasonable
2:05:41
so is that right we haven't figured out what the dummies are going to be doing well I'm the dummy yeah the
2:05:52
ugly dummies will go with the smartness to make sure nobody picks them
2:05:58
right yep and then you know the the two paladins I guess
2:06:03
we'll kind of Freewheel it yep right and upon each in a pub different Pub
2:06:09
and then um go from there how's that sound to everybody uh yeah so how are you
2:06:16
splitting it exactly Howard how are you splitting it exactly
2:06:21
oh so I guess it would be uh one each the paladins going to different bars
2:06:26
right doing the pub roll and then with no one we're so low okay gotcha
2:06:35
and then we're pairing up I I you know I don't know who wants to do with what but you know we could have Jason's character
2:06:42
hanging out with the wind and elmore's character hanging out with Amico and that way they've got some muscle with
2:06:49
them right as they do their little more sketchy sort of undercover
2:06:56
Pi stuff that makes sense
2:07:01
again okay let's go with uh uh to win and uh
2:07:08
well hold on just a second Mike Howard did you want to do a divination on that or do you want to just try it and so the
2:07:16
definition is about my course of action okay so if I'm if I'm going to be paired
2:07:22
up with Jason's character doing private eye work um so and I I'm guessing we're going to
2:07:28
do it in a different part of town a different part of the district than uh then uh
2:07:35
Aaron and uh I guess it would be Elmore yeah
2:07:42
um so maybe we you know we take the south side and they
2:07:47
take the North side or something like that all right and a little pub crawl East and West so is that does that leave
2:07:53
you and me uh Brad no we're so low we're solo okay I got
2:08:00
you right here we ought to be able to take care of ourselves we're still you know yep I got
2:08:06
you at least that's what I'm thinking yeah so you would you and span and uh
2:08:15
Elmer and uh Arisa
2:08:21
that would be Marcus okay I'm sorry Marcus and dewin and uh
2:08:29
Galen and amiko Amico
2:08:35
gotcha all right the the party is good with the split yep
2:08:42
yeah all right so I will just go in order of who is on my Discord list all right so
2:08:49
Howard and Marcus you are doing a quiet investigation
2:08:56
yeah I'm thinking um we would have uh probably legade flying uh looking around
2:09:03
for um obviously anything that legade can see in terms of
2:09:09
um you know people wearing the obvious cult symbols or anything that looks like that
2:09:16
or perhaps anyone trying to do you know a transaction to
2:09:23
yeah something like that um so that's our our eyes and ears above
2:09:29
us and we're just kind of sorry negate
2:09:36
that's his Bird that's okay okay gotcha
2:09:41
that's that's my drone
2:09:47
I don't actually like that I put myself In Harm's Way organic throne
2:09:52
foreign better eyes than I have
2:10:01
where are we heading to do that the way I thought it would
2:10:07
win yeah on accident yes I didn't realize it
2:10:14
would do that I'll do it again without it I don't know Howard roll
2:10:22
okay um so obviously I think I need to use uh my
2:10:29
uh Inspiration Point here foreign
2:10:38
[Music]
2:10:46
[Music]
2:11:07
all right but I was gonna I'm just going to use the Divination to
2:11:12
kind of head off whether or not that was going to be uh you mean Aubry or hungry I'm sorry the
2:11:20
definition so that I could perhaps tell if that was
2:11:25
going to be either well you had to use no for you well that was gonna be the first step
2:11:31
that we discussed right now yeah I kind of thought we decided to
2:11:37
skip that is
2:11:44
foreign
2:11:54
I was just gonna say that's Howard's thing for Howard's action we were talking to Jason and I kind of thought
2:11:59
we had dropped it but you know that's that's kind of Howard's thing I kind of thought we had too because you
2:12:06
split the party in four ways well that was the plan and then
2:12:12
action right and then I the conversation was he you know was he going to do a
2:12:18
divination on his effort first not the rest of us
2:12:24
right he can only do a divination on his action not ours yeah the definition has
2:12:29
to be on on my choice and my actions I don't think it covers the answer I mean go ahead and burn the oh it's a ritual
2:12:36
but go ahead and throw it
2:12:46
because it would be independent of uh whether or not you succeed in your dice
2:12:51
or not but I mean what's that mean that just means you're not gonna do anything then
2:12:59
wrong tree if I get a low result that I'm not bad
2:13:06
doing that I know I'm not gonna and I can perhaps change
2:13:14
what does it look like when you where are you doing it well I I suppose you have to sit down
2:13:21
you have to lay out like uh you know I guess it could be tarot cards or you know something that
2:13:27
you know you're looking uh looking for uh
2:13:34
Clues and whatever comes up something like that so there's you have
2:13:42
to sit down and kind of do some kind of arrangement of something in front of you that's uh
2:13:48
that gives you based upon you know tarot cards kind of the obvious one I could I
2:13:53
could think of that I don't think simply like that well what I mean is like what does yours look like
2:13:58
oh um I'm I'm thinking he would roll some kind of uh dice
2:14:06
um and based upon the dice results so I don't know it wouldn't be like numeric
2:14:13
dice perhaps it's like um things come up on the dice that look positive or
2:14:21
negative or neutral or it has little symbols carved into it Arcane meanings that kind of thing yeah
2:14:30
and and what specifically are you asking well you don't really ask it it's you
2:14:36
said about a course of action and then they all tell you where they're not that course of action is going to be positive
2:14:42
or negative
2:14:50
uh uh low end wheel
2:14:56
and wheel for good and bad results so something
2:15:01
good will come out of it and that will come out of it and go through it
2:15:08
all right well then it doesn't sound like it would be a total waste of time and I suppose we would go through with it right which which means my which you've
2:15:15
done so the second group would be uh Aaron or
2:15:21
sorry Amico and uh Galen are you doing it as a a Charisma or an intelligence
2:15:29
investigation that's gonna that's gonna be on her
2:15:36
because both of those on me is uh not good all right
2:15:44
the social engineering you can still you can still help her and give her
2:15:49
Advantage so the the elf doesn't have high charisma no no
2:15:55
I find I find that shocking I'm uh I'm a non-magical elf
2:16:01
elf
2:16:11
you gotta ride the short tree [Laughter]
2:16:16
and who's gonna be doing the rolling I think Charisma would be a better way for
2:16:22
us to go because you know I mean she's not really high intelligence wise
2:16:30
before that um I did want to I was going to use the mirror on on our Rasputin
2:16:38
wannabe but I think I'm going to use it on myself instead
2:16:43
um okay no they want to be I do not understand this one to be I don't know
2:16:50
this does not Translate all right so um how would I use the
2:16:57
mirror uh mic I think it's just a makeover isn't it
2:17:03
uh yeah but it gives me charisma
2:17:12
yeah it advantage on three Charisma checks
2:17:17
so so you were just you would use the mirror and then have advantage on three Charisma jacks
2:17:23
so do I just click on it it's not a it's
2:17:31
you just say you're using it oh okay we'll just go ahead and do that Home
2:17:37
Group magic items you know so um so yeah
2:17:44
uh like like what kind of actions are you doing to get information or are you
2:17:50
like trying to meet people and like kind of sweet talk them out of it or are you
2:17:57
trying to persuade them to give you information uh about it and trying to trick them into
2:18:04
giving information um I was actually thinking and I don't know if oh my God uh I don't remember
2:18:12
what what is the elf's name David Galen um I wasn't sure how Galen felt about us
2:18:19
uh are there any like um are there any like religious things in
2:18:25
that area in in that way there is a uh it's a it
2:18:31
is there's a church of soon oh okay so it's the slum version of the
2:18:38
church well I wanted to go it's not nearly as pretty it's more of the religious
2:18:45
spiritual aspects of the religion less about the the looks
2:18:51
well um yeah would it be possible for me to go
2:18:56
to my church and uh you know check in with them and see if they persuade them to uh
2:19:03
yeah if they've heard about anything see if they've heard anything or or any
2:19:08
rumors or any anything like that about this thing
2:19:14
um any information that they might have
2:19:25
that sounds like a good idea to me all right so what why don't we first try
2:19:30
try my my uh the low down version of my church
2:19:36
and see if if they have any if they've heard of it anything or if they have any information for us and this attempt also
2:19:44
costs 15 gold that's fine and it's basically you're you're doing things
2:19:49
like you're you're buying a gift basket for the church right right yeah that's fine are you buying some
2:19:56
engines so the most a prompt they're waiting for you to roll advantage
2:20:02
um which what am I rolling is it Charisma or it's right there in the chat
2:20:08
bar oh my goodness let me see
2:20:15
where is it oh it's the persuasion
2:20:21
oh let me see here oh this isn't this is neat I've never seen
2:20:28
this before and make sure you roll it advantage
2:20:34
advantage and I'm going to give them the best gift basket that they have there so yeah if it's more than 15 it's fine
2:20:43
foreign
2:20:48
they are grateful they accept this gift basket of incense
2:20:54
and fine fruits and make sure to knock off the uh the 15 gold
2:21:00
and uh but they don't they don't know they've not heard of this eye thing that
2:21:07
you're talking about okay sure have they heard anything about
2:21:13
that other cold water around
2:21:19
that didn't bring any bells sorry but thanks for the gift basket
2:21:27
um all right so um would we be able to you know go somewhere else in the city uh well you
2:21:35
will be but because the party is split up I need to keep it rotating okay no that's fine
2:21:43
um but if you couldn't put deduct the 15 for me that would be great uh could you because I'm trying to move on to Matt
2:21:49
and I don't want to have to manage your character I can do it for mine I'll do it for mine that's what's all that
2:21:54
money's for anyway for expenses
2:22:01
all right where are we at uh so now we've got uh Hamlin Hamlin
2:22:07
you're you're going for the drinking route well the the car is rude I should say uh oh yeah so
2:22:14
we're looking to use to get this information there's you could try and trick people out of it you could try and
2:22:21
intimidate people if you think that like oh you know this this gang leader gang
2:22:27
member looking guy probably has something I bet I can shake it out of it or are you trying to be persuasive and
2:22:35
smooth talk the information out of them well uh I have investigation but my
2:22:43
investigation stat is not really great uh uh well you're not very well I mean
2:22:50
you could go for intelligence but I thought you said you were gonna be doing the Charisma route yeah that that
2:22:56
that's my thought so um right so I find myself in a CD dive
2:23:03
is that what you're saying like I said you can intimidate it out of
2:23:10
somebody that you think has the the info you can try and sweet talk I'm out of it by persuading them you can lie to them
2:23:17
and try and trick them into exposing information so what are you going for
2:23:29
well I'm going to try to find out what I can about uh the cult
2:23:35
uh first right and so I will inquire how are you going about doing that
2:23:43
uh uh in other words what skill are you using uh Charisma and I will use it to
2:23:50
that's not a skill that's a stat so persuasion intimidation or deception pick one uh
2:23:58
persuasion persuasion okay
2:24:07
and I will try to find an in for the cult of of this uh what was it again
2:24:16
find it well there was there was the uh the Watchers of vitriol and the cult of set
2:24:22
okay the Watchers we'll try the the the cult of Israel
2:24:28
in right in uh a generic term so uh normal role
2:24:35
yep and she got nobody there to give you help all right
2:24:41
there you go
2:24:50
I wish uh two to find my my brothers and sisters in the cult of
2:24:58
uh itro I understand that they have a following here in the Water Deep
2:25:07
it's an interesting tactic here David roll the dice well that's what I just
2:25:13
did I know I put another one oh another one okay
2:25:22
uh persuasion again no it's just a T20 oh D20
2:25:32
okay for some reason I can't see the D20
2:25:41
it's in the chat bar no I I couldn't get to it
2:25:46
well I don't know about that you say this uh slightly above average
2:25:54
is you know so you're presenting yourself
2:25:59
as a member of the Watchers or was it Set uh no just uh
2:26:05
trying to find their uh the the the sanctuary here in the Water Deep you
2:26:12
know with a little bit of coinage yes you spend five hours uh
2:26:20
talking to people you do spend 15 goals okay
2:26:26
this investigation and you get back some some interesting responses uh uh that
2:26:33
some strange people have been seeing around an abandoned tenement to the South South East sorry Southwest
2:26:41
near The Honorable night okay yes uh mine posted as being condemned so they
2:26:48
shouldn't be there but uh you know if I were if I were a man
2:26:54
interested in doing something uh Shady well I I wouldn't do that here but you know I
2:27:03
I suspect that they're they're from out of town uh I do not understand this dishonorable
2:27:10
uh it's uh it's called The Honorable night
2:27:17
I said near The Honorable night can you drop the accent
2:27:24
are you being serious yeah
2:27:29
I like it as a character trait but it makes it a little bit difficult for me okay I must break you yeah
2:27:39
[Laughter] okay uh this honorable and I do this
2:27:44
again they see they're telling you that strange people have been seen around an abandoned and it
2:27:52
abandoned tenement to the southwest of The Honorable night not far from the The
2:27:58
Haunted The Honorable night okay this this this honorable night that does
2:28:05
not sound too honorable that's just the name of an inn
2:28:11
oh yes I got okay I'll shake my head yes and head that way
2:28:22
and then Brad I'll Take On The Honorable night for 15.
2:28:28
uh Alex what's that say what uh what what
2:28:34
charisma skill are you using or are you going intelligence well I'm gonna now I'm gonna go since he used uh the the
2:28:42
positive part so well I'm gonna use intimidation so you're gonna look for somebody Shady
2:28:49
yeah [Music]
2:28:54
they're kind of you know have some sort of leadership position
2:29:01
you know I got you I got you so um
2:29:06
I oh okay uh I uh want to use um my inspiration
2:29:13
go for it so um
2:29:19
and do do I do that in here or do we just roll it it'll come up with an
2:29:24
option for Advantage does that give me Advantage the
2:29:30
or does it just give me a plus inspiration gives you Advantage okay all
2:29:35
right yeah I see I see that you'll have to check it off from your sheet manually but but then when you roll up there you
2:29:42
go there we go you just beat the [ __ ] out of somebody
2:29:49
got some information scared the [ __ ] out of them
2:29:54
all right I'm intimidated the [ __ ] out yeah
2:30:02
go ahead and give me a rule okay just a D20 yeah
2:30:14
big rules better watch out you're gonna use up all the good ones
2:30:19
that's my quota for six months I think see you find somebody that looks a
2:30:26
little bit on the Shifty side and you kind of you don't rough him up
2:30:32
but you you make it clear what will happen if he doesn't give you something
2:30:37
uh and he he says no man I I don't know anything about no Cults or no eyes man I
2:30:43
just it's the ones in my head but but if I was suspicious of anybody
2:30:48
I would say first in the cunning has been acting strange lately
2:30:54
keeps talking about an eye I just figured it was her just she's been holed up by herself for a while now
2:31:02
and he gives you the location of this verse of the cunning
2:31:08
and where and where is that that location
2:31:16
what was was that an honorable night yeah
2:31:22
okay that's up on uh slip Stone Street
2:31:27
apparently she is a a minor Conjurer
2:31:34
she got associate she hangs out with or he doesn't know
2:31:42
all right lately right that's everything I'm going to get
2:31:48
from him I'm not gonna that's all you're gonna get from him and it was
2:31:55
slip Stone Street yes absolutely
2:32:02
all right I saw this map though is it yeah it is it's yeah it's underneath your overly large
2:32:16
very acid but that cost me 15 gold
2:32:21
it did it cost me oh it's not like paid him off afterwards to keep his mouth quiet
2:32:28
keep his mouth shut yeah all right I'll buy that
2:32:35
and then don't you go right in your mouth okay so uh we gotta meet back up
2:32:43
right that was everybody's attempt that was everybody's attention did we have a plan to meet back up
2:32:51
you actually did not make a plan to meet back up
2:32:57
meeting back up at the gates okay which Gates we're at
2:33:06
that makes sense although I don't know you know you could
2:33:12
meet up in version Square just you know I'm checking out what's going on it doesn't live up to the name
2:33:20
I doubt it all right so you guys meet up
2:33:28
um share the information and what's what's the plan
2:33:35
I don't know what do you guys think so I'm feeling pretty pretty good about this uh Ursa character
2:33:42
uh well we're all back together yeah yeah
2:33:53
uh honorable night
2:34:00
you want to split in two and check them both out you want to stick yeah you know what's this part of it would probably
2:34:06
ought to go as a group because you know who knows how many goons she might have hanging out too I mean I don't know
2:34:13
okay also just just as a reminder it's been five hours so it is you know
2:34:18
getting on toward afternoon late afternoon the early evening
2:34:24
I'm okay
2:34:32
a whole different part of town
2:34:40
did to win saying that he wants to make it The Grand Tour and and burn down
2:34:45
something in each district well it's good to have goals
2:34:51
if they're set people there there's got to be fire right so
2:34:57
I came back at the right moment
2:35:04
I mean we're not going to set it on fire but set we'll set it on fire
2:35:12
see you guys are going to go to ursa's I think so don't you guys agree
2:35:18
yeah sounds good let's see that's one of the best quotes we got what was the other one
2:35:24
pretty high
2:35:29
now another one was the one that uh uh
2:35:36
which was that there's a lot of suspicious activity going on in The Honorable night area
2:35:42
no it's Yeah by The Honorable night not in it oh okay is The Honorable man is that a
2:35:50
hotel or something no I see yeah can you see the map yeah
2:35:57
there's a huge letters down at the bottom except in the southwest corner
2:36:02
and I believe it's ironically named right
2:36:08
quite possibly considering this award all right see you guys head to slip
2:36:15
Stone Street and it doesn't take you very long to find to the shop of Ursa the cunning
2:36:21
um you know again this is uh that this is definitely the poor District right so
2:36:26
there's a lot of tenement buildings run down there's a lot of trash
2:36:33
um a lot of people begging on the streets a lot of homeless
2:36:39
hey can you can you move that big character icon
2:36:46
that big character right it's right in the middle of the screen
2:36:54
yeah I think you're hallucinating you might need to refresh Brad okay
2:37:00
because it's the it's the it was a big it's a big icon of Jason's character
2:37:06
there's one off to the side that was you know reduced down in size or whatever
2:37:12
man I mean you can't really get enough
2:37:17
pictures of me but in this case it doesn't believe it's awesome yeah that that fixed it one last picture
2:37:25
of him all right
2:37:34
let's zoom in there and uh versus a uh it's a fortune telling business it
2:37:43
has a sign up above the door or it's on the the first it's in the basement
2:37:48
uh shop uh of this kind of rundown looking
2:37:53
tenement building and the the door is locked but you can
2:37:59
see someone just sitting on a chair rocking back and forth
2:38:09
I know where is she a diviner uh you do not know her but the sign says
2:38:16
that she specializes in fortune telling and Talisman crafting that could mean that she's a diviner and it could mean
2:38:22
that she's just selling stuff to poor people who want a lottery ticket
2:38:29
should go in and get their Fortune told and okay
2:38:37
or should you be the voice of the Gods beyond the rift and spilling out
2:38:42
knowledge that you cannot consume oh wait a minute I'm sorry I'm speaking
2:38:48
with you again without the accent
2:38:59
on the street is it middle of the street South End North End it's about halfway
2:39:05
down okay all right so you're saying the door is locked yeah
2:39:10
all right well um yeah maybe because you don't know that
2:39:16
or not she you can see someone sitting in the shop is there is there a uh a good Vantage
2:39:24
Point nearby you know like uh Pub or something with you know beer
2:39:32
garden this is a slub is there like a food cart
2:39:37
around there there are uh yeah this is a a big enough street that toward the uh
2:39:44
toward High Road uh which would be about halfway down the street yeah they do have some food carts
2:39:52
and they they appear to be getting ready for dinner but further down where her shop is it's
2:39:59
more uh well I want to say residential but you know what I mean
2:40:06
so uh is is is any of that food car is there any one
2:40:12
cart that's more Superior servings than the others by by what measure well like by taste I
2:40:19
mean it's like one like better you're gonna have to taste them to find out I mean is it like one like steak on a
2:40:26
stick oh no no no the meat on a stick okay
2:40:35
they've got like meat on a stick they've got uh like barley soup
2:40:40
served in a leaf bowl in a Dirty Ashtray
2:40:47
uh they've got sausages of Unknown Origin um
2:40:54
you know what that's that's that's a dream come true for the Marines
2:41:00
so uh all right so no no laugh yeah no I'm just gonna let that go for
2:41:07
right now you [ __ ] communist um so let's see is anybody got is it just
2:41:16
me and Rasputin and have high Charisma yeah what about
2:41:22
um Iko Amico what's your charisma he's 13.
2:41:28
what's yours but if you use the mirror what's it bump up to it I just get it managed
2:41:36
and I'm not taking that mission in there um so it seems like our choices are persuasion
2:41:44
intimidation or buying her off well I thought I
2:41:51
thought I might you know somebody had the idea you go in and get your fortune told so I thought I might go in there and get Fortune told
2:41:58
you know take somebody with him yeah take somebody with me you know
2:42:04
um in case things get sideways or whatever but I'll go with you I mean I like the idea I mean I'd
2:42:12
probably take um I don't know it might be too intimidating if I'm like I go in or
2:42:19
somebody but you know yeah with somebody with a low Charisma you know you could be big like that and have a high
2:42:24
Charisma but the Russian guy will never shut up so he'll go in there and start talking and blow the whole thing so
2:42:33
I gotta take somebody else in there with me to win would you want to go while I get my fortune told maybe you
2:42:40
could stand off to the side and see you know if she's like full of [ __ ] or whatever I will go with you and I will I
2:42:46
will keep my uh I will keep my mouth shut you're still on probation
2:42:52
super secret probation yeah I think that's a good idea I think the rest of us should like cover
2:42:59
the that cover the doors whatever you know like the back doors or side doors
2:43:04
or Windows make sure to try to crawl out of there yeah that's not a bad idea maybe you know a pair out front
2:43:10
you know go get something from one of those carts and act like they're just standing there eating it or whatever and
2:43:15
then maybe you see that sleeper's lock road back there maybe a pair out there in case there's a
2:43:24
back door to the building or something and it comes running out the back and this the folks on sleepers walk
2:43:30
nobody will pay any attention to them but you know just in case so people on slip Stone Street there
2:43:36
probably you need to stand there where are you talking about so
2:43:42
you see the map right yeah so right there probably put a couple
2:43:48
people on sleepers walk right to watch the back door I will
2:43:54
point out that there's like an alley in between yeah that we'd be watching The Alley yeah like standing right there at
2:44:00
the alley and sleepers walk yeah okay and then I thought you thought
2:44:06
you guys were going towards the honorable night I'm sorry you're good
2:44:11
but not yet we may have to after this I don't know what I did
2:44:17
yeah why don't I keep an eye on uh Flip Flip
2:44:23
Stone after you go in with um I don't know amiko and then maybe uh
2:44:30
Galen and uh um
2:44:36
what's your name Matt recipe
2:44:42
I will go wherever you want me to go Hamlin yes
2:44:49
in Hamlin and um and uh Galen did that slip Stone
2:44:55
Alleyway area and then you and amiko can
2:45:02
and stand out front is it Amico yeah yeah that's fine
2:45:09
I get those names so I'm gonna walk up and knock on the
2:45:15
locked door uh you can see a person inside that they
2:45:20
they don't even Flinch there's no sign that they recognize the knock on the door
2:45:26
okay so I'll knock a little harder same
2:45:32
[Music] wait we don't have any Rogues do we
2:45:38
do not we have a bunch of big guys wait
2:45:47
no the wizard maybe has knock Ed that's what so she's just
2:45:56
sorry so um still trying to get the names going CeCe
2:46:01
is knocked on the door she's sitting there just not flinching right and nobody else is nobody else is visible
2:46:08
no not inside the shop now you said this was just so I get the
2:46:15
story you said this was a basement shop that she ran yes correct so I actually
2:46:20
knocked out on the door to a business to get in that and I would have to go down
2:46:25
a set of stairs to get to her no no it's like New York where it's a basement entry oh yeah okay I got you I got you
2:46:31
okay all right yeah uh so what do you think they're doing
2:46:38
I can knock the door down I'm sure but um
2:46:43
you got any other bright ideas um
2:46:51
I'll come back later
2:46:56
our um I could go in without knocking
2:47:04
but I'd be in there myself I'm sorry did you check the doors it's locked
2:47:10
it's it's locked right yes Mike yes it's locked or barred in some way
2:47:22
seen anybody going in or out of uh the back area of that place it's a residential tenement area there
2:47:30
are people all over but of that particular
2:47:35
the ground is she is a basement unit of a tenant apartment building
2:47:43
okay is there a back door can you see there is a back door but
2:47:48
people are people are using it I mean this is their home they're coming and going constantly
2:47:59
is there a door on the back of the shop uh you see a curtain pulled across but
2:48:04
you don't know what's bought Beyond it okay but the wind if you were talking about being able to get inside could get
2:48:11
inside and unlock the door like it's a locking mechanism obvious
2:48:18
that I can see from the street side it looks like just
2:48:24
a normal uh turn lock so on the inside it's just a standard
2:48:32
knob s
2:48:38
wants to watch in other words you don't need a key to unlock it is it just your turn you turn there the
2:48:45
knob is I'm sorry I understood none of that
2:48:52
right which is which is fine which is fine
2:48:59
um
2:49:06
so I'm going to use precipitation to see if I can
2:49:14
make a loud sound right next to the person that's on the inside
2:49:20
just started them
2:49:28
so that's just a can trip yeah all right so you you cause aloud
2:49:35
bang and uh they they just keep rocking back
2:49:41
and forth and and you can see her lips moving but you can't hear what she's saying yeah she's in some sort of Trance
2:49:47
I bet foreign
2:49:56
filthy years of grime is it open
2:50:03
yeah no it's not they're Rusty ah can I use them you're supposed to grab his
2:50:09
knob yeah any novel do yeah
2:50:16
who's in the alley with me look
2:50:27
look if people are coming in and out of that
2:50:34
back door let's go let's go walk in and see if we can uh
2:50:40
sure you want to leave your spot and go in
2:50:47
yeah I'm not smart you go into the back and it's I mean this is a a it's literally
2:50:55
it's an apartment building so there are just you're in a hallway
2:51:00
you see a stare at the far end going up um and then there's just doors all along
2:51:07
this hallway and you can tell that based on the spacing of the doors these are pretty small apartments
2:51:15
is there a downstairs is there a way to go down there is
2:51:23
I can only go up but is it you're going
2:51:30
well I was just gonna see if we could get into that you know Department
2:51:40
I'm gonna I'm gonna walk up to the front door and kind of just lean into it really
2:51:46
heavily to see if I think it's possible to open the door you're you're absolutely
2:51:53
sure that if you wanted to put a little effort into it you could pop this door
2:51:59
okay well so we we could break in or we could come back the next day
2:52:06
and see if we have any more luck or maybe just a few hours once it's dark
2:52:11
out you know if we're gonna break into a place it might be better to do anything
2:52:17
yeah well it's just her and she's in some kind of Trance I guess are we
2:52:22
expecting her to come out of this trance at some time at some point I would I I would expect so I mean I you know she's
2:52:29
doing some sort of magic thing but I don't know she could be you know somebody Coulda
2:52:35
cursed her I don't know turned her into a [ __ ] incantation chatting zombie but
2:52:42
um it could be speaking to her uh for God yes yeah so I mean you know it might
2:52:49
be better to just back off for right now for a little bit and then we'll plan on
2:52:55
knocking again in the evening and if she doesn't come out of her trance then we'll break in when it's later you know
2:53:01
what I mean well do we want to keep an eye on her and make sure she doesn't sure we can hang out by the food carts
2:53:08
you know and in the meantime we want to send some people down to the honorable night are
2:53:13
we like it uh it would be quite obvious uh we you know this uh people oh big
2:53:22
I think we need to go yeah you give the smaller people yeah
2:53:30
well okay well we could do something like um you could set up shop on a corner and
2:53:37
start preaching about um ill mitter and how he can save everybody
2:53:44
and we can act like we're watching what you got to say until it's time to do something
2:53:50
[Music] no I see get got a good idea you know
2:53:57
what do you guys think yeah I guess I'm fine with that idea but
2:54:02
I'm wondering do we have time to like investigate anything around the
2:54:07
honorable night or we just want to wait that's basically on the other side of
2:54:13
the district yeah and that's a pretty dodgy area
2:54:20
I you know the honorable we probably don't want to do at night
2:54:25
right we'll probably want to do that during the day so I mean we could go over there and check it out if you want yeah you know
2:54:32
what time is it it's mid-afternoon I guess
2:54:38
yeah you guys had to walk to waterdeep that was like an hour or some odd
2:54:44
then you split up spent five hours and then went back to
2:54:52
the gate to meet up and then decided what you're gonna do then you went back across
2:54:57
the awards to slip Stone Street and you guys have been here a good while discussing what to do
2:55:03
so you're talking like five in the afternoon five or six
2:55:09
zoom out okay well that's good that's good wait then with your the idea of
2:55:15
descended to the preacher man and I will preach I said no I I I'm good
2:55:25
it's only gotta he's only got to go for a couple hours you know and then are you gonna use religion or
2:55:33
uh persuasion Matt or perhaps intimidation yes what's your sermon like
2:55:40
I know I speak of truth I speak the truth
2:55:46
you can speak truth and still be intimidating that's true you know [Music]
2:55:53
what I don't think that God is suffering is going to be intimidating people it's just yeah I mean it's got a
2:56:00
suffering isn't here it's Hamlin yeah
2:56:05
you wish you had the god of suffering here now you have me yeah that's true
2:56:14
why can't I find my guy here oh there we go all right
2:56:21
uh so we'll do uh uh religion no no no no no no no no
2:56:28
persuasion all right persuasion yep
2:56:33
so you try a little gentle persuasion yep
2:56:39
uh uh as opposed to Performance same thing we'll do performance that's fine yeah
2:56:46
performance would be fun I will give a a very rousing sermon
2:56:55
well let's find out indeed
2:57:00
yeah so tell me about your rousing persuasive uh my goodness
2:57:07
Hamlin's coming in clutch on these these questions you spend your days wasting your body
2:57:15
for this thing that you wish for and he goes on about that
2:57:22
I I just can't do it [Laughter]
2:57:27
one of the people actually like starts speaking in tongues and has it come to come to illmit her moment there
2:57:35
you go he's he's he's cheering you on full-throatedly
2:57:40
he's he's had a Revival of sorts there you go
2:57:47
but only one he he does not even know what he speaks of he's he he is he is he
2:57:52
is uh he's found his inspiration right
2:57:58
right so after giving this very impressive sermon on the corner how long were you
2:58:04
guys doing that oh until the Sun starts to go down
2:58:14
all right so desk arrives Hamlin wraps up his sermon
2:58:20
and I would I will take the uh the the the the Oaths of the of the sinners
2:58:26
uh here as well right right right an altar call an altar call there we go
2:58:35
thank you uh you you actually collect uh like
2:58:41
four silver pieces I don't want silver pieces I want people to convert
2:58:49
but you only got one conversion oh damn it
2:58:55
that's one is enough one is enough one is enough
2:59:03
Matt you do have an alms box to collect donations for the church oh do I okay yeah yeah yeah I mean did you say
2:59:11
four four okay
2:59:16
because remember elmetter does a lot of things not just like suffering on a broken wheel
2:59:22
the Church of illmeter runs various hospitals hospices
2:59:28
uh Research into medicine and you know political issues to ease the
2:59:35
suffering of the world you said uh every silver piece counts
2:59:42
three four four oh
2:59:47
four silver feet every silver goes to a starving child in
2:59:53
Silvery Moon yep
3:00:01
see you guys go back in the desk uh not a very well-lit Street as as
3:00:07
slums tend to be uh what light you have is coming from
3:00:13
the various Apartments as people return home from a day of drudgery working
3:00:19
their Gary Lowe pay jobs cleaning streets shoveling out stalls
3:00:26
you know garbage hauling from various locations to dumps outside the city
3:00:33
and they they return home with their their meager earnings to eat a lonely
3:00:39
poor meal and sleep so they can do it again tomorrow
3:00:46
you approach the shop versus accounting there is no light in the shop
3:00:54
hey I wanted what you know with my shield uh do a
3:01:01
perception check on on the door or anything around
3:01:07
uh sure what kind of things are you looking for I'm looking for any type of uh Trigger
3:01:14
or alarm uh trap uh booby trap you know something that's
3:01:21
gonna you know something something like that things like that all right
3:01:36
all right
3:01:43
so I oh I click the dice okay which device and then Advantage all right
3:01:53
very nice so you you hold out your does your Shield
3:01:59
do anything special when you're using it's it's features like this or
3:02:04
anything uh I just I I probably feel it through the
3:02:11
hand and arm as it does as it as it Center something before I'm aware
3:02:18
so uh examine the the door the door frame the
3:02:24
lock the handle um and who was confident that there are
3:02:29
no traps for wires uh of a physical nature uh unfortunately
3:02:35
you can't see magic so even if there was one you couldn't tell but at least from
3:02:42
the mundane you're confident that it's safe okay and I'm going to pass that on
3:02:49
everybody else it appears to be okay to uh hard press the door
3:02:55
okay so let that that brings to mind I probably should have done this earlier
3:03:00
but um that Divine well I don't what was it that
3:03:07
that Rasputin used earlier where he was detecting
3:03:13
what was that Divine sense Divine Divine sense so maybe I should use my Divine
3:03:19
sense here and see if uh see if I can detect any particularly
3:03:24
good or evil Undead anything like that sure near vicinity
3:03:32
the role for that no no you just have to burn the uh burn the use
3:03:56
it'll be under features well it's right there on the on the top to four uses so you just put
3:04:06
I think you just click on it it should should earn a use like laying on hands
3:04:12
well it's going I used it
3:04:19
um so as you hold out your holy symbol and and ask
3:04:24
for Roz guidance uh in in detecting evildoers or those
3:04:30
with ill intentions in their hearts um
3:04:36
I don't think anybody in the party is evil so that's fine
3:04:41
um you do you don't detect any one of particularly evil or good intent
3:04:49
within the radius of your spell um you also don't detect any
3:04:55
um you don't detect any signs of like Undead or Abominations or anything like
3:05:01
that okay all right so I have night vision
3:05:09
can I see anything in the shop you know there's a table
3:05:18
um she's kind of like if the table was here she's kind of like sitting at the table but at an angle to it
3:05:26
she's still sitting there and she's still chanting or whatever murmuring
3:05:31
she's still well she's she's moving her lips not fast just you know you can see her lips moving like she's mumbling
3:05:38
something uh you don't know what but she hasn't moved the table itself has like a ratty
3:05:45
purple velvet tablecloth on it uh the kind you would associate with you
3:05:53
know Carnival fortune tellers almost um the shop itself looks pretty bare
3:06:00
um you see like a like a Franklin Looking stove in one corner where she apparently uses
3:06:06
for heating and cooking um the curtain in the back still not
3:06:12
sure what's behind that um and then there's some some old red
3:06:17
bear tapestries on the wall um with you know depending on what you
3:06:24
whether you believe it or not nonsense about you know Peter behind the veil see
3:06:29
the truth it's hidden behind from you that's keeping success from you
3:06:37
Fortune I'm gonna go back to to win here and ask
3:06:43
him do you think we should try and go in the shop
3:06:54
I suspect that she is in the middle of some kind of spell
3:07:01
it sounds like it [Music] and if we go in there we're going to
3:07:08
interrupt that spell and it will probably be consequences from that yeah
3:07:15
yeah well she obviously won't be happy about it but I don't think we we don't see her as a good actor right so
3:07:23
what she's probably doing is probably not good maybe not
3:07:30
directly for us but for somebody you know what I mean
3:07:35
so we might be stopping an evil before it actually
3:07:41
occurs that assumes that our intelligence is correct and this person's actually
3:07:47
somehow involved if she's a quality that's whose name got oh pretty I rolled
3:07:52
pretty [ __ ] high on that natural 20 and followed up with an 18. so that's probably pretty good data
3:08:03
what's the success rate on intelligence from torture
3:08:13
space got really serious from the camera huh huh no I'm looking at something else
3:08:19
okay he has no connection with uh reality on
3:08:24
that one uh generation from reality uh you know
3:08:30
on torture it's all on how you vet it you know that's right you know I mean
3:08:37
you connected with other uh Intel does it does it uh does it sort out
3:08:44
so so what does a group think should we go in or not uh I would go
3:08:50
I thought about it I think we should go in yeah I kind of think you'll go in and even if we break
3:08:57
up her spell or spell can't be anything good
3:09:02
if it is we could profusely apologize I'm pretty Charming she might be under a trance
3:09:09
yeah she might be in need of help yeah I kind of wondered that you know like maybe
3:09:15
maybe cursed or something that's a really long spell otherwise the
3:09:21
old ones uh have a tendency
3:09:26
capture the essence
3:09:33
so Duane are you are you in
3:09:38
because you're our way in actually so all right what could go wrong what could
3:09:46
go wrong uh uh all right
3:09:53
all right I'm I'm gonna go in there and if things go wrong I
3:09:59
expect you guys to come in right behind me yeah can you open the door when you go in well we'll go in you just open the
3:10:06
door let's go I will have to go in before I open the
3:10:12
door yeah yeah if something goes sideways we'll just break the [ __ ] glass and go
3:10:18
through but you know trying to be a little stealthy about it all right here we go Mike yep
3:10:27
all right so to win conjures up The Mists from the
3:10:35
street vanishes in in one Cloud bank and appears in another inside the shop
3:10:41
uh the wind go ahead and make a con save easy wait wait
3:10:49
a second I see somewhere um something
3:10:56
I I think I saw this die roll happening um in a dream and
3:11:02
it came up at 13. I'm pretty sure that's that's what happened all right so as as you you step out of
3:11:12
the the missed Bank your your nose is assaulted
3:11:17
with the smell of rotten food human waste
3:11:23
just now that you're inside and can see clearly that this room is obviously
3:11:28
showing signs of neglect like she hasn't moved in a week
3:11:34
oh great um are you going to examine her or open the
3:11:40
door first no I'm unlocking the door all right so you unlock the door and everybody can come in
3:11:47
um you see that she is a human uh probably about 27 28 something like
3:11:54
that uh her face is tear strain to your
3:12:00
stained dirty uh that deep dark bags under her
3:12:07
eyes like she hasn't slept in many days
3:12:12
um she's clearly dehydrated uh hasn't eaten hasn't slept hasn't
3:12:18
drank uh and she's just muttering to herself you can't even make
3:12:25
it out uh just at the edge of a whisper
3:12:34
okay so let's look around the shop for just a little bit here let's let's see if we can find anything inside this
3:12:41
store that is tells us what her condition is or
3:12:46
um provides any clues for the eye sure so uh searching through yeah I
3:12:53
assume that one of the first things you should go after is that curtained area and there is a a twin sized
3:13:00
sleeping area not much bigger than a little Nook basically
3:13:07
um old sheets but they they are cleaner than the rest of the room
3:13:13
so some care had been put here um
3:13:19
there's a couple books uh in the sleeping Alcove related to like there's a there's one
3:13:27
book on uh hand exercises to keep your fingers limber for dealing the cards
3:13:34
that you need to deal um but that's about it as far as there's
3:13:40
no personal items or anything like that there's there's some clothing on a shelf she has
3:13:46
a total of two dresses um and that's kind of it the shoes are on
3:13:54
her feet uh very very little there's there's what food had been here it is
3:14:01
long since gone bad uh there's a bucket of water but it's it's stagnant uh you
3:14:08
can see the film starting to grow
3:14:14
from moles in the bucket they're suffering uh it's various as far
3:14:20
as her is concerned uh she's got like there's there's some some uh little stands where she's got like a
3:14:29
a gilded box that looks very nice but when you get closer you realize that
3:14:34
it's really cheap it's just meant to look good from a distance
3:14:39
and inside that there's like a worn deck of tarot cards uh there's uh there's a
3:14:47
pup with various lengths of sticks with symbols written on them
3:14:53
um you assume that it's it's for like dividing in some way
3:14:58
fortune telling that kind of thing and then of course there's herb you know
3:15:04
dirty tear stain dehydrated soiled
3:15:10
this wave is this wave her her life is forfeit she
3:15:17
has uh she has given her life to others we must
3:15:22
free her from her bondage okay I have a lesser restoration spell
3:15:30
I picked her up Mike and I I try to set her on the bed
3:15:36
let's try to give her some water well yeah see if we can break that fancy then hold
3:15:44
on hold on so maybe you know uh Rasputin if you could maybe lay some hands on her
3:15:50
yes my cows are uh health
3:15:57
yeah her mouth is is currently fine other than the conditions that I've heard we
3:16:04
need to break or trance my brother need to break yeah so I'm gonna try a lesser
3:16:11
restoration lesser restoration as a very specific
3:16:18
list of things that it can cure yeah and this isn't it parallel yeah but
3:16:25
it's it's the the effect paralyzed I slap her in the face a little bit and
3:16:31
splash some cold water on her okay she she starts she flinches from it but
3:16:40
oh and by the way the water that you're using is from the bucket so like there's now slime streaks down your face yeah I
3:16:47
thought of the allergy right right after I did right after I did it I thought of that it's not cold water it's [ __ ]
3:16:53
feeded water um
3:16:58
yeah we're carrying water we would give her a lot of water
3:17:06
contract
3:17:26
it's a matter of it's a matter of where you've been to where you are you know I mean it's uh
3:17:32
did win could you can you figure out what's going on with her is there anything you've got that might be able
3:17:38
to figure out what's going on with her um
3:17:44
Mike twice an obvious spell effect here
3:17:51
um you don't see the obvious spell effect uh you you would wager that
3:17:56
whatever is wrong with her it is Medical in nature rather than mystical
3:18:03
um she has all the signs that you you you've seen symptoms similar but never
3:18:09
this bad I I will say this um because of your your your particular
3:18:15
School of magic uh you do know that sometimes if you're not careful you you divine in
3:18:24
a way that is not safe for Immortal Minds to divide
3:18:30
uh she's seen a truth she's not meant to see
3:18:35
what was that our she has seen a truth that she is not meant to see
3:18:42
he's you know she probably saw that high right
3:18:48
wow she may have been using the eye and you know they talked about
3:18:54
they're being danger involved with I um right is this something maybe we
3:19:01
could take her to uh [Music] some other Wizards or clerics maybe to
3:19:08
to examine her you know maybe they can maybe they can't help her but
3:19:14
um how to do something you know
3:19:19
but like the wind said it's not necessarily magical in the magic
3:19:27
damage or magic trance the the the source of the problem was
3:19:33
magic but the the at this point it's not magic maintaining it it's more of a
3:19:39
emotional shock that has caused a big break
3:19:44
had compounded with at least a week of physical neglect what
3:19:50
about uh wasn't there some sort of uh uh
3:19:56
uh Temple Amigos the cult Temple there don't they do healing there
3:20:02
I think you've just been demoted him ago you're now a member of a cult not a
3:20:07
relationship I mean you know
3:20:15
a little well I mean let's face it the one you
3:20:21
follow is true everybody else right that's right I'm a paladin right I mean
3:20:26
I am a True Believer so you know you are all Heretics until I convert it will
3:20:33
happen that is absolutely right you could take
3:20:39
her to the uh the temple they may be able to to provide care
3:20:45
I mean if nothing else into Life Care you know um something
3:20:53
we can't just leave around there does provide hospice care well maybe that's the way to go I mean I
3:21:00
don't know I I don't know that if there's not one nearby I don't know that we want to be carrying her all over the
3:21:06
city and her current condition but maybe I mean I don't know
3:21:13
maybe we could take her to the nearby one and if they can't help her then maybe you can make a medicine check
3:21:21
[Laughter] what's that I said anyone that wants to can make a
3:21:29
medicine check well I mean I could do a detect poison and disease
3:21:34
I'm working on it here and I I have pure wounds which I know says
3:21:42
hit points right but it I'll do a medicine check I was working on it
3:21:49
well Emily doesn't know [Laughter] perfectly healthy it's just beyond my my
3:21:58
uh [Laughter]
3:22:10
literally no no doctors in this group yep threw a doctor in the house hey somebody
3:22:17
help me I'm not really good
3:22:22
Roofing and change your socks rub some dirt on it walk it off
3:22:29
right right what's a Nico's medicine who's got the highest medicine
3:22:36
I had a plus one eleven it's better than mine tell you truth
3:22:43
um Nico are you there you're muted
3:22:51
I have a plus two sorry I have a plus three so I was going
3:22:58
to to do use my inspiration and see if I
3:23:03
could roll it down I'll help her
3:23:17
no all right
3:23:23
all right that's good enough um you suspect that she's the the main
3:23:29
problem is that she had a tremendous mental shock combined with severe dehydration and
3:23:38
starvation oh my goodness
3:23:45
on what what could cure that who could cure that
3:23:51
food and water to start with will she accept water like if we if we try to put water in the dry mouth yeah
3:23:58
I'm gonna try I'll try to pour some water in her mouth so you would lift your head up she didn't choke yeah
3:24:05
just add a small amount of water yeah use your water scan uh can you get some water down down her throat
3:24:13
and she seems to be improving
3:24:19
dehydrated her lips were cracked and bleeding
3:24:24
I know they have at least a little bit of moisture back in them
3:24:29
I'll slowly kind of continue to do that very slowly giving her water
3:24:34
all right she starts to recover a little bit
3:24:41
and her her mutterings are a little bit more coherent now that you can do Rhythm
3:24:50
um and she's just uh but one thing that you can tell
3:24:57
is she talks about staring into the eye too long oh
3:25:03
and that she lost the greatest treasure she would ever have oh
3:25:10
I asked I asked her what happened to the eye on taking stolen they took it from me I
3:25:18
lost it who is they you know she's her mental
3:25:25
state she's not able to say
3:25:30
all right well let's let's get her someplace uh where they can help her and
3:25:38
uh I don't you know I don't know if if emitter is better or the closer Temple
3:25:45
is better what was that Temple of uh uh
3:25:51
Temple of student is where they went uh yeah because that's my temple and
3:25:56
isn't she like it got a healing or she's a goddess of beauty Beauty
3:26:02
okay Beauty and love and sex
3:26:08
if you want this dehydrated starving befelled witch to to get banged out of
3:26:13
the Vermont well she's already out of mind so I mean you know the banging problems
3:26:21
um do we feel we've thoroughly searched the uh the room the area
3:26:28
well if you want to double check it but yes we have somebody go and take her and
3:26:34
while the others investigate I mean we got these a bunch of Behemoth men here
3:26:39
who I'm sure one of them can carry her is the Temple of illmit or close by or
3:26:47
is which temples go ahead and uh you're not sure you don't really follow
3:26:53
illmeter
3:26:59
Rasputin does hey no yeah unfortunately Hamlin is not from this
3:27:05
city so he yeah he's definitely not from here he's definitely around here
3:27:10
all right but isn't the uh isn't that the Temple of Illinois and
3:27:16
Water Deep like one of the most well-known temples
3:27:24
maybe in some Source books
3:27:30
take her outside and start asking people where that Temple is maybe they'll well hold on I can do it I can do a religion
3:27:36
check right to see if I know where the temple is and yeah you've been living here for a month
3:27:41
yeah we ran into some Illuminator guys what basis would you have
3:27:47
well now we we dealt with the illmeter guys before right with the you have with
3:27:53
the stuff
3:28:04
you're looking for something in the trade board well let me see how we're going to check how close is the
3:28:12
one I [ __ ] I don't know anything close so
3:28:17
I ironically enough there there is one on coffin March
3:28:24
coffin March up north
3:28:31
oh yeah that's it okay well so let's
3:28:38
Maybe Rasputin and somebody go take her up there I don't want to send him by
3:28:44
himself just in case somebody okay just in case
3:28:49
somebody decides that they want to finish her off or something yeah I think that's a good idea
3:28:56
and then who has good investigation who's staying I do not
3:29:03
well you're leaving you're going to take the her to your temple
3:29:16
um let's meet out by the high road there high road and like sweepers
3:29:24
wow so yeah but no let's let's meet we'll meet you at uh
3:29:32
that corner there in the street of the test you know that open area there
3:29:37
yeah Burton wagon way it's a little north of
3:29:42
us you know kind of halfway like Burton wagon Wayne Street of the tusks
3:29:50
that's yeah see there's like a little four-way yeah yeah okay
3:29:57
all right because it won't take us long
3:30:02
so the four of us who are left who has a high investigation
3:30:11
if not me yeah I bet it's the win
3:30:17
yeah okay so um I'll uh who's got the second highest
3:30:25
I only have the base let me see I kind of look at mine it is
3:30:31
awful and that would be investigation right or
3:30:36
perception what depends on how you're doing it so
3:30:43
it could it could be either you you could like intuitively look around and
3:30:49
receive something or you could try and do like a more methodical
3:30:55
uh investigation either one would take you about an hour okay so I'll help the win and Galen can
3:31:03
help uh Amico because she's got to have better the second best scores for whatever we're
3:31:11
using I have for a percept my perceptions better than my investigation because my intelligence is just kind of
3:31:18
middling yes my perceptions better than that than
3:31:23
that mine yeah well we'll just you and you and I will just help
3:31:28
so they get advantage on their roles because our scores aren't going to be that great
3:31:34
sword swingers right so I'll help the win you help uh amiko do
3:31:41
whatever
3:31:46
yeah that would be fine uh does Dwayne want to go first
3:31:56
I can put a role Mike go ahead
3:32:02
and you're you're getting help yep
3:32:09
all right so you investigate you're checking the ashes and the
3:32:16
fireplace underneath the table uh in the bucket underneath the bucket
3:32:21
looking for loose Rewards and after an hour of meticulously
3:32:27
tearing apart this this little shop you find nothing more than what he's already
3:32:33
found oh wow okay okay
3:32:38
an Eco you want to give a perception try
3:32:43
um okay sure that advantage
3:32:52
is no good either but yeah [Laughter]
3:33:00
so now you're about uh yeah about well it's past it's about two hours past dusk
3:33:07
so Knight has fully set um and it's getting uh dark on the streets
3:33:15
the lights in the the apartment tenants uh are being turned down now
3:33:21
they have to go to sleep early because they can't afford the uh expense of running candles or
3:33:29
burning oil you need more than they absolutely have to
3:33:35
this is sounding like a whole underclass proletariat things
3:33:41
every city has its underbelly okay so uh I don't there's nothing else
3:33:48
here you guys want to leave ready to go yeah I think we're done
3:33:57
the party from the the shop is leaving
3:34:03
um and you're walking along you you notice uh some Street urchins
3:34:10
and beggars are following you coming out of the night
3:34:15
first it's one then it's two then it's three okay and they they seem to be getting
3:34:22
more no they're not approaching you they're not threatening you in any way
3:34:28
they're just they're behind us okay so
3:34:34
um uh we're gonna head up towards this wall up here right in the uh I suppose it's a
3:34:40
gate I'm assuming that the the wall is better illuminated than the rest of the
3:34:46
streets right uh yeah okay mostly uh the wall is actually
3:34:53
because it's kind of more space that's that's the homeless encampment uh Mike
3:35:01
um is this a good time to call sure
3:35:09
you're welcome I would just say that uh I want you know anybody with me to be in
3:35:15
front of me if they're behind us they need to be up in front of me
3:35:21
just in case you know what you want to be between them and them off yeah yeah and I think I'd probably lead
3:35:28
the way towards the wall it was a small group so you know it'd be like a diamond formation probably
3:35:35
right Galen trailing and all uh uh be on point and
3:35:42
whatever all right let's go ahead and wrap up the Stream okay
3:35:48
thanks everyone thank you so much
