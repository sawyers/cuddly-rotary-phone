um just to recap the party was was fired by the information broker uh Jared
0:13
Johnson who introduced them to elsewhere Fontaine they took a meeting with Ellsworth at
0:21
the uh the Pepper Ridge Farm which is a converted in
0:27
um and they they met some new people along with their employer we've got uh
0:34
what are the names Hamlin hellfang uh Marcus Maximus and Galen Goran
0:42
have joined the party um as either uh you know introduced by
0:49
elsra or introducing themself or in the in the case of uh Hamlin just deciding
0:56
that he was now working with the party it was it was it was preordained
1:03
it it was meant to be it was fate
1:09
um and the the party was tasked by elsra after giving them the this tale of
1:16
a a rather dangerous artifact appears to be on the loose
1:21
in or around water deep and she is concerned about the chaos that it will
1:29
wreak if left unchecked and it is also being sought by at least two other
1:36
groups organizations I should say at least one of them uh is running around
1:43
with the emblem of the cult of set she has paid a significant amount of
1:51
gold to each party member to ensure not just loyalty but performance
1:59
giving each character a thousand gold up front and the promise of more at the end
2:06
in compensation for honesty loyalty and service in this matter
2:13
the party has immediately gone to the uh trade District of waterdeep which is the
2:21
definitely the the wrong side of the street as far as waterdeep is concerned
2:26
uh it is the the slum District uh with some trading along the center line
2:33
because it does have one of the main gates but overall this is the uh the the tenement area of Water Deep where all of
2:41
the peasants that live on the you know the the two copper a day lifestyle this
2:47
this is where they all live so all of the uh the the stable boys and
2:53
Couriers and just ordinary poor people living their
2:58
lives that would be peasants or surfs out in the countryside uh all all live in this District kind of
3:05
crowded in with various small businesses and whatnot
3:11
um the party last I gotta check my notes here because I'm
3:18
getting old uh let's see what was the name Ursa yes so the the last significant thing that
3:25
the party did was they they encountered Ursa the cunning uh in her fortune
3:31
telling shop and found her that has effectively psychically damaged by some
3:37
event uh and upon giving some some amount of
3:42
care to this you know sleep deprived food deprived and badly dehydrated woman
3:49
she was only able to reveal between crazed mutterings that she had lost the
3:56
only Treasure of her life uh the party decided to split at that
4:01
point with Hamlin and uh wasn't it
4:09
I think I think the two of you decided to immediately take her to
4:15
um a temple of illumeter sort of a uh
4:21
what do I want to call it easier it's kind of like a religiously maintained
4:26
Clinic that's what I was gonna say yeah Clinic um would be the best way
4:32
uh I don't Eniko didn't go it was uh
4:37
let me get the names right here um so it was
4:43
uh uh I know him on wet and I think
4:50
and yeah so then then I I apologize Marcus and
4:56
Hamlin the the two most physically intimidating people by their thumbnail decided to take a Mission of Mercy by
5:04
taking this this badly hurt woman to the
5:09
the clinic um the rest of the party uh concluded their investigation in the fortune
5:15
telling shop and we're walking along the wall to get to the clinic
5:22
and they noticed that they were starting to get a bit of a uh a crowd Gathering
5:29
up behind them um right now there's about five people
5:34
following behind the just Street people
5:40
um you know if you've ever been to to a larger City and you've been followed by like a homeless person you kind of know
5:45
the vibe that I'm talking about and that's where we left off so that's
5:52
where we shall start so um let's start with the people being
5:57
followed by the mob and then go to uh Hamlin and Marcus at the clinic
6:04
a little bit of uh just refresher she was unable to give us information other than
6:11
she lost a very important item correct well literally she said she lost the
6:16
only treasure she ever had in her life right and and and we determined that she was what again
6:25
I I don't know what you're looking for she was a fortune teller you're you're not you weren't able to
6:30
determine based on the the paraffin Elliot in her shop
6:37
whether or not she had any significant magic ability
6:44
um it's it's not there there's no like spell or something like that to like detect the Arcane threads lingering
6:50
behind right I think well I'm just saying she's been she's been how did we determine that she had been harmed
6:56
that's what was my question I guess she was near catatonic long enough to
7:02
dehydrate okay like she she probably would have died
7:08
within a day or two if you hadn't come along I got you okay
7:15
I guess I could describe it as like severe severe trauma mental trauma she
7:23
you didn't find any like physical damage no no Burns no signs of torture nothing
7:30
like that okay I'm assuming that there was a degree of modesty in checking her right
7:38
um but you didn't find any obvious signs of of injury or damage pass to a present
7:44
okay it appears to be all emotional you know mental trauma
7:50
okay um
7:55
if I if I remember correctly when did make the point that uh the
8:02
artifact that you are seeking this dangerous artifact is known to be a a potent artifact of
8:09
divination and sometimes when you look Beyond the
8:14
Veil it looks back oh yeah yeah although I I don't know exactly how to
8:21
win would describe such a situation so I will let uh doing finish his his meat
8:26
snack that he bought off a street vendor before saying anything that he wants to
8:32
say but but that's that's the the gist of it foreign
8:43
wasn't to go all the way to the clinic we were going to meet up with the rest of the party there in that Junction of
8:51
uh burnt wagon way and
8:57
right right right right right yeah uh off of the high road
9:02
or was it by the uh the part of the wall I forget which I think it must have been by the wall
9:10
along the wall in the first place yeah and
9:15
as it as we left it we had just you know kind of come around the corner there yeah yeah and uh oh wait Sleepwalker it
9:24
was sleeper's walk that's right right where we were
9:29
wasn't that where the store was where was the store yeah
9:35
okay so by the way I apologize if any of
9:41
the features don't work like normal um like I was telling uh people earlier that there was an update on the the back
9:48
end for Forge and not everything seems to be working correctly just yet
9:56
so we may end up with technical problems but hopefully we won't have too much difficulty
10:07
so is everybody back at the right place yeah and so does the wind have anything
10:14
to add about the the dangers of divination or is it good enough
10:20
I I would say that's good enough um is it and so divination
10:27
Mike and this is me asking you as the DM to describe the mechanics of divination but there
10:34
are extra planar beings
10:40
that basically communicate back to someone with those Cur
10:46
um Arcane abilities and sometimes there's extra extra player
10:51
beings it can become a two-way communication and there are days which is quite dangerous yeah
10:58
um it does depend a little bit um you know Magic as a mechanical system
11:07
depends a little bit on the Outlook and perceptions of the person using it
11:13
so it is not impossible that you would have
11:19
um definition that is nearly a form of time travel where you send your
11:25
awareness forward or back along the flow of time to see possibilities uh it could
11:34
be in the form of like formulas where you're getting some sort of like odds of
11:41
odds of an event happening kind of like uh the old Isaac Asimov Foundation books
11:47
if you've read those um and then there is the most common which is
11:54
you you kind of tap into this extra planar consciousness
12:01
um and it's not the same Consciousness every time
12:06
um sometimes they are benevolent most often they are ambivalent
12:12
uh but on occasion they are actively hostile think HP lovecrafts you know
12:19
knowledge that was not meant to be known oops
12:25
so um what's that blowing your mind
12:34
um so that's what dewin would know as far as his experience and teaching as
12:41
far as definition is concerned now you've not said specifically what types
12:47
of Outlook DeWitt has but I assume that it is the common one right now
12:57
yeah his son obviously his journey into divination is
13:03
relatively new exactly
13:13
all right so it's um so Marcus and Hamlin yes so Marcus and Hamlin are are
13:19
up north by uh Bert wagon way up here at this
13:24
intersection okay you you guys went ahead to take the the fortune teller to
13:31
the clinic so you're you're unfortunately not there to see the uh the growing
13:38
mob and while the you guys have been talking um it has grown again so now there are
13:48
about 15 people following behind
13:54
hey can I tell if they're about ready to attack us or any of their intentions
14:00
um they don't seem to it it really is like
14:08
the feeling is is really very much like you have nice equipment you have food
14:15
money and and they want it but you you don't
14:20
feel like impending violence yet
14:25
I'd also say that you know I have that Warhammer of warning so we're not going to be surprised by an
14:33
attack you know if they decide to attack us we'll know you won't be surprised but yeah right I mean we
14:41
we're ready you know we have our weapons free and all that but well I I would I
14:48
mean this is a rougher part of town but just in general remember that you are in like a city and while it is open carry
14:56
they probably wouldn't like you like walking around with it effectively at
15:01
Arms can't remember why are you walking around with a bare blade kind of a deal
15:09
I don't know you know you know
15:14
and I'm not hold on I'm not saying you can't have it out or or that it would
15:19
necessarily cause problems I'm I'm just saying it's like starting a bar fight
15:24
right sometimes it's a good idea and sometimes it gets the guard called on you
15:30
I'm simply pointing it out so that you're aware of it so that there's no hard feelings if the guard gets called
15:36
on you but
15:41
I got a question you yeah I'd hate for I don't know if my character
15:48
something or if I carry it in my hand all the time say that again I don't know
15:54
if I if my character you know the The Sentinel Shield I don't know if I've if
16:01
I'm carrying it in my hand you know ready to go or if I like stow it
16:08
either way you yeah a lot of people would just carry it okay I just want to
16:15
make sure that I've got it in my hand and ready to go yeah yeah that's not particularly threatening
16:24
um but if you're walking around with like uh uh a javelin or something like
16:30
that ready to hook at somebody or a bear sword or something like that then yeah that's
16:37
gonna get attention more so than than carrying a sheath sword okay
16:43
uh it would be like uh you know would you would you go around with an arrow knocked and ready
16:50
to go shopping in Texas man
16:59
in Texas but in Texas they would laugh at you for using a bow and arrow instead of an AR
17:09
yeah maybe so by all means you you've got your weapon
17:14
in hand Brad and that's fine sometimes
17:21
that's all I wanted to say Mike is it also fair to characterize uh
17:31
the big city um that getting the goal the guards called
17:36
on you is a bit of a crap shoot uh right because especially in this
17:41
District because the guards aren't necessarily
17:48
entirely on the side of Law and Order shall we say
17:53
right well the the the the in the nicer areas
17:59
like the castle District or the high District you're going to have a lot more honesty from the guards
18:06
whereas here it's kind of a yeah you know I can make this go away because
18:12
that's a lot of paperwork but it's gonna cost you it was I was more concerned about hey
18:19
these guys are kind of in or away what do you say we get them thrown in jail on trumped-up
18:24
charges kind of thing hey that one's got a weapon out how about we make something out of that
18:35
there's definitely that too certainly
18:41
um the the guards in this district there are several several Patrol units that
18:47
would not hesitate to find a reason to throw you in jail
18:53
just if you piss him off kind of a deal think think the stereotypical like
19:02
movie style Southern Sheriff right it's the are you assassin back to
19:10
me boy and even corrupt ones it's not good to
19:16
kill them
19:25
all right so we're just hanging out have we made it to our meeting location yet uh you you're still walking along
19:31
there's been some discussion back and forth about the nature of divination and whatnot
19:36
uh you are up to 40 people following behind and they are getting closer
19:45
okay what exactly sparked this off you don't know no no one's talked to him
20:00
leader of this mob it it's it's effectively a flash mob
20:09
and at this point they are they're descending upon the the crowd they don't have any weapons out
20:16
but they are all pushing and shoving each other the party begging for food
20:24
begging for coins they're they're shouting there's people starting to come out to see what's going
20:30
on um what are you doing
20:43
is there some one of them closest to us it's a mob of 40-something people
20:49
I say we just pick one guy out and accuse him of stealing from us and start chasing him
21:02
maybe that'll disperse the mob unless anybody's got a hand grenade
21:09
let's just keep moving and if something happens we'll react to it all right
21:17
at this point you're not really able to make progress because they are
21:23
surrounding you basically are they blocking us from getting to
21:29
where we're trying to go not they are blocking you unless you choose to use force or some other means to uh
21:38
get them to disperse all right so uh all right so I'm on point then and I guess
21:46
if I know where I'm going I'm just gonna start uh I'm gonna try to
21:52
move one of them out of the way you know the tour on the back end what
21:58
I'm thinking am I in the back am I in the back I I don't know where you are
22:05
for what order we were yeah I was bleeding you were in the back and
22:11
then to win and Amico were between us okay
22:16
I mean there's no reason you can't flow to the front it's not like we're in a tight or anything
22:23
Mike uh you need those reception tests oh is that what that sound is when I
22:30
hear it yeah you mean you need what check the chat
22:35
all right perception chant I can I could I can do a percent
22:41
mine's plus wait hold on
22:46
mine's plus four everybody got no all right
22:54
I'll do it well it's each each of you need to roll so oh
23:03
did the dice actually roll yeah I did I didn't see it I didn't see
23:09
it either I saw my score come up 22 there
23:15
hmm okay so let's see here
23:22
um so this is all happening basically simultaneously so so Galen and emico
23:30
you you both feel a hand try and go for your your coin purse uh we're not there
23:36
right huh what we're not there all right you're not there so you don't roll
23:44
so I thought you said Hamlin oh sorry sorry I said emico and Galen
23:50
okay
23:56
um and you you push away the hand before it can get to your coin purse
24:02
um but say and doing do not notice it um
24:08
you you lose um 10 gold
24:13
and when you lose 30 gold
24:20
they do not know all right okay just a quick follow-up
24:27
um does the Falcon give me any change to
24:32
that um I'll tell you what you can roll for the
24:38
Falcon I don't have a token for it let me put one out
24:45
um because it's visual well it's it's a visual check but
24:51
uh let's see here
25:05
your bird is missing no [Music]
25:12
it is not in the the familiars folder where it should be
25:18
um so you're I can't prompt you for it you're just gonna have to roll for it so what is the The Familiar get
25:30
I'm not uh I'm not sure because I don't have the
25:36
sheet for the food that should be on your uh DND Beyond character sheet right yeah I'm going to go over there and look
25:50
my dishes away that's why I always have him on the lookout because he is better than me at
25:57
this
26:25
I had to figure out where it is in d d Beyond yeah I'm looking too
26:41
oh I thought there was actually like a section for familiar
26:54
yeah there is a section for familiar you can just never added it
26:59
right
27:09
uh I've got [ __ ] but no falcon
27:17
is it a hawk yeah let me let me see if I can
27:28
it wants to load Page by Page and it's using the entire monster manual
27:34
for the familiars so perfect well
27:40
so I it doesn't it say in the spell description let's just go to spells
27:47
there's a certain spell description and it has
27:54
yeah no no falcon
28:04
the spell description does not
28:22
foreign [Music]
28:44
yeah let's not hold up the game for this all right so it gets uh the passive
28:50
perception of 14. um it does get advantage on ones that
28:56
that rely only on site but you're actually like perceiving someone in a crowd trying to
29:02
pick your pocket that's not necessarily relying on site
29:09
um but it can I'll allow you to roll so the wisdom role
29:15
looks like it's it's a A plus two for percent sorry plus four four perception
29:23
so roll and add four I I rolled up I rolled a 20.
29:31
foreign
29:36
in that case because you rolled a one and it rolled a 20. I'll I'll only pick
29:42
10 gold multiple multiple hands were coming in
29:48
to win look like an easy soft mark of course he did
29:55
inventory all right I assume that
30:02
um legate has notified me that I'll try to pick my pocket yeah it it noticed after the first
30:09
withdrawal had been made from the bank of dewin
30:19
um can legates like start pecking at people uh
30:26
familiarism [Laughter] I mean it could Peck at people but it's
30:33
it can't it literally can't do any damage well I mean I think of preemptive effect
30:38
would be good I'll I'll look at updating my sheet to
30:46
include the familiar thing so that I I did add the hawk to your your DND Beyond
30:52
sheet um so that at least you know where it is
30:59
okay but it's under extras extras okay
31:05
all right back to my other notes
31:12
so you guys are being mobbed there is just this screaming
31:19
mob of 40 homeless people Beggars poor
31:25
people yeah character actors from from Times Square all demanding money
31:32
yeah can we see who uh who swiped the bag or the the coin
31:39
sorry oh um you didn't see any you you know well
31:46
you saw the person that was trying to swipe yours but this this is a large crowd and it's
31:55
constantly shifting well I have low intelligence so I think if I can see them and I am in with arm reach if I
32:03
could grab them you know we might just want to start you
32:08
know making an example out of a thief oh my God anybody else
32:13
well has anybody done so like somebody stole coins from me but has anybody in
32:19
the party no coins see they did stealth quotes from you but you don't know it that's what I'm saying yeah
32:26
I'm gonna tell if I was I able to tell that he got
32:32
the information that you got from your role was for you specifically all right
32:37
well I'm gonna notify people that you know hey we're they're trying to hit us
32:47
[Music] I just want to kill something
32:52
well I don't I don't necessarily think we need to kill anything but I do think go ahead
32:59
uh I'm going to uh cast presentation
33:05
however you pronouncing it interested in education breasted vegetation yep um
33:12
in an effort to make a very big loud uh thing that maybe looks
33:20
like a fireball or something to hopefully scared I'll put your people away you see a flashbang
33:26
yeah you know but I'm gonna make it look like I'm casting you know meteor storm but you know right right right yeah
33:39
yeah let me think about that
33:46
so I am going to let's see here
34:05
[Music]
34:13
oh great intimidation you know what uh
34:18
well that's exactly what you're trying to do you're just using magic to do it yeah no that's that's that's fair
34:24
um I I'm going to go ahead and and use my uh inspiration because I want to make
34:31
this an inspired so you want it to be an advantage yeah all right
34:39
nice see so you what are you doing like meteor swarm or like a gigantic Fireball
34:46
or or what's the scene that you're setting here yeah yeah and I I'm I'm trying to make a big show of casting the
34:54
spell like is obvious and as you can and I'm trying to make it seem as though I am calling down the Thunder of the Gods
35:01
um a lot of loud spell casting and slamming your staff into the ground kind of that thing
35:08
yeah the Press Administration is just supposed to give something it is a magical effect
35:15
yes all all of the the other actions are are window dressing right right got it so
35:24
um you you throw up this you know flash bang that that uh of magic
35:32
with lots of loud bangs and
35:39
and it causes the the crowd to scatter
35:45
there's there's screens of he's gonna burn us all right wow
35:56
okay so which
36:02
I got better run before he turns us all into newts
36:11
a wizard made me impotent months run
36:17
the crowd just starts running for it
36:24
uh and within moments the the party is is once again free of
36:31
uh free of issue also Howard they they no no no never
36:38
mind so uh you know the the last stragglers you see like a a crippled seven-year-old
36:46
limping as fast as he can away in front of her on a single crunch
37:09
his pants
37:15
bless us everyone
37:21
um but yeah you you know you you've got blind people being led away as fast as they can crippled kids
37:29
you know level nine um but you are once again
37:35
free on the streets able to continue along
37:41
if you're not gonna do anything we'll jump over to the clinic anybody before we make a jump
37:48
I'm just I'm just hoping that gives me a little bit of street cred
37:58
well he's tough against children watch out foreign
38:11
so I'm not hearing anything for the the group on the street so let's jump to uh
38:17
the group at that clinic good uh I have a question for uh Hamlin okay
38:25
how are you approaching this how are you introducing yourself
38:31
are you openly uh carrying your your symbol and whatnot or no
38:37
that'll be kind of tucked away a little bit in the folder so you you guys uh who's
38:44
who's carrying the uh the the hurt woman
38:49
uh suppose it makes sense if I was all right
38:54
so you you approach the clinic um and it is it's
39:00
clean for the slums I'll give it that it's not maintained well and it's kind
39:07
of a rundown larger Building looks like it was a converted Warehouse
39:13
um but at least while it is not like physics structurally well maintained it does appear to be at least efforts are
39:20
made to keep it clean all right um you approach and enter in through the
39:26
the front Gates um well I shouldn't say Gates there's no yard you enter in through the the front
39:34
door of the the converted Warehouse that you know it's it's it's one of those big like wagon-sized doors with a regular
39:41
sized door built into it sure so you enter through that yep so so
39:47
we're here yeah yeah yeah yeah this is happening at the same time that the mob was happening and where's the mob
39:54
located uh what mob you don't know of any mob yeah well no the the mom was was down by
40:01
right right around here on the map yeah you're right I wouldn't know about it so fair yeah okay
40:08
um do I um do I sense any danger um as we enter the clinic
40:14
[Music] um I mean nothing like normal danger no I
40:21
mean just malpractice it depends on your particular
40:29
character's personality I suppose um this is a clinic in a poor District
40:35
so there are people here who have you know treatable diseases that other
40:43
Wards don't have um there's a lot of people like in the
40:48
waiting area with with obvious infections or wounds
40:53
um there is for example there's there's a rather tough looking man sitting there with a broken bottle jammed into his eye
41:00
oh a knife they are are trying to get someone to
41:07
see him more urgently because he's bleeding profusely um but will have uh you know some pretty
41:14
epic scars to talk about after if he survives uh how close do we get to him
41:21
to the the Thug yeah I mean he's sitting in the waiting room
41:27
like holding his face he's he's he can get as close as you want to oh do we
41:33
have n95 masks but you're right I mean there is like
41:41
like there is sickness there is um infection there is a crippling damage
41:50
from people that like you know there's a kid who's got like an
41:55
open bone fracture on his leg and he he's apologizing to his mom because he
42:01
was just with his friends and they they all the other kids would go along the rooftops and he thought it would be cool
42:08
too because that's what everybody else was doing is that is that anything that lay on hands can help
42:16
damage but not disease okay so I could actually it I think it
42:23
can I I thought it was higher levels that it could heal disease I'll have to look
42:28
because there was something about that because I okay anyway but I could I could heal the compound fracture in
42:34
other words you you could heal the compound fracture yes I'm feeling the pull to go help this
42:40
child the thug it will take uh Five Points of healing
42:49
I don't know if I want to to uh to uh
42:55
bring uh attention to myself though
43:05
why don't we ask who's in charge here uh there are nurses
43:10
uh going about they're they're quite obvious they're they're wearing white
43:16
smocks um with their hair tied back in a tight bun uh and most of them have a white
43:24
mask on but yeah I just get this feeling that that this person's not going to her slow
43:31
is not going to be getting healthier well what do we why don't we see who
43:37
find out who's in charge and ask them if they are able to do anything uh do I see
43:42
anybody who has any kind of uh
43:48
well you know from experience that that the typical setup of these types of
43:54
clinics it's kind of open and open enrollment as it were you just approach a nurse and
44:03
tell them what's going on and then they will let you know what they can do and how much it's going to cost okay
44:11
um
44:17
right yep
44:24
it won't let I was going to make a role in it when you let me roll down here anymore
44:31
uh you should still be able to I hit the I hit the dice icon
44:37
yeah the the the dice tray doesn't work anymore but if you use
44:43
um forward slash R and then D20 and then the text it'll it'll roll a dice for you
44:50
okay I got you that's why I was saying that there's been technical difficulties because of
44:56
the update all right all right thanks peace
45:05
um I'm gonna approach one of the uh one of the the nurses and yep ask her
45:12
I'll address I'll very quietly I will address Her Sister of Mercy uh We've
45:17
we've brought a an older woman here who has suffered
45:24
some sort of mentality Oh I thought Ursula was was old no no she was dehydrated okay
45:32
malnourished you know in in a bad way and and probably going to die soon but she was
45:39
not old she was she is uh like mid-20s okay
45:46
human okay all right um so I'll point out I'll wave my hand
45:51
towards her and and uh say that we found this woman Ursula in uh in her shop and
45:57
she was pentatonic and on the verge of death by dehydrations
46:03
and starvation and uh we felt compelled that we should
46:08
bring her here to you the the you know ladies of Mercy to to uh to take care of her
46:16
um we weren't able to get much information out of her but um she's still muttering like incoherently you
46:22
can't really make out anything that makes sense it's just like random gibberish and and we fear that that
46:29
she's been way laid by something um I see something that is that is uh
46:37
not quite understandable to the most common vote well we can certainly care for her but
46:44
I'm sure you understand that mental issues can be very difficult to treat
46:51
there's no guarantee it's not like a a wound or even a disease it could take
46:57
considerable time and effort um we can't guarantee the the outcome of
47:02
such a a perfectly aware of such thing I just I just know that that if we she was
47:08
left to her own devices that she would she would be done she would be dead soon
47:14
see she she turns to uh Maximus are you
47:19
the husband I am not the husband we found this woman
47:28
say again she's asking if you're her lover or husband or family member
47:34
yeah we we were we were uh to we were to come
47:40
to her Shop to uh ask her some some for some things and uh we found her this way
47:47
I see well we can certainly admit her um it would be
47:53
10 gold um and that would cover
47:58
the first week uh will you be paying for extended care
48:05
or just that week that seems highly irregular for someone
48:11
we've found uh for a complete stranger to me and unfortunately it's the way of the
48:19
world she's a stranger to us as well we only have so much resources to spend and
48:25
we we have to prioritize does this does this sound like a normal thing or does this sound it is a reasonably normal
48:32
thing the the church itself can't give away Medical Services to the world it would
48:39
run out of money right I just didn't know if that that seemed uh it is
48:44
customary and reasonable it's a little high on in your opinion but it's also a major city where prices
48:51
are more expensive I would have searched the woman's
48:57
belongings to see if she might have a HMO insurance card
49:03
unfortunately no right you you do get like a handful of
49:09
cockroaches that were hiding in her pocket though okay wonderful
49:15
well I don't know for 10 gold I I guess we could try it out for a week and maybe
49:21
stop back back by in a week and see if there's been any problems would it help if we give you her her address and where
49:28
she can be founded and see if there's any family members
49:34
um well we can we can certainly look after but but the the current matter is
49:40
what it is
49:45
well if uh him and I maybe we uh we let the woman know we're gonna have a sidebar and we kind of step away and we
49:53
We Talk Amongst uh ourselves about the price and the value of it
50:02
so Hamlin what do you think you want to give a 10 gold to see what happens maybe stop back by it by later and see if
50:11
there's been any progress and then make it another decision at that point yeah yeah we can do that
50:19
okay so I'll go ahead and I'll pay the 10 10 goal that I'll give you I'll give
50:24
you five well you'll split the difference I guess yeah five and five so
50:31
I'll go ahead and dedex five gold all right
50:39
you you deposit the money and they actually do write out a receipt
50:46
uh and hand it out you know whoever wants to take it can take it but it's it's a receipt accepting
50:52
that uh the the clinic of illmeter in the the trades Ward is responsible for
50:59
that the care feeding and and treatment of this woman
51:06
and um that it has been prepaid for one week okay I'm gonna I'm gonna request uh each
51:14
of us get a receipt individually for tax purposes
51:22
she kind of seems puzzled by that but okay she makes two receipts
51:29
thank you uh and then they they load her up onto a
51:34
uh a wheelchair and start Wheeling her back into the converted Warehouse uh talking
51:41
reassuringly to her of okay Jerry let's get you cleaned up now you'll feel much
51:47
better when you're cleaned up did they get her name from us
51:52
yeah they did okay but unless you didn't tell her no we did okay
51:59
with um we'd also like to request that um because we've paid for her medical
52:05
care that she has not released to anybody except for us I understand someone someone that that
52:12
has been through trauma certainly wouldn't want to release her to someone who caused the tournament
52:19
you also do understand of course that with this kind of case we do let the guards know
52:27
this poor woman massive trauma yeah so that's fine we just want to make
52:34
sure that she is not released to anybody else except for us we will certainly not voluntarily
52:40
release it but you you do understand that we're we're nurses and doctors here
52:46
we can't fight a determined adversary I don't understand that
52:55
do your best I understand she she's she only comes up to like lower chest on you Maximus and
53:04
she's just gonna reaches up in pets it's okay Deary we'll make sure your
53:09
girlfriend is safe [Laughter]
53:15
yeah uh and at this point unless you're gonna do anything else I I'm gonna assume that
53:23
the party then rejoins I'm gonna look around just a little bit and you know kind of see if
53:30
you see anybody that's that uh I recognize or anything like that
53:37
uh you know keep my hood up and uh
53:42
you know look suspicious yeah yeah I'm gonna look
53:48
so spit I'm not not intentionally looking so this is it's just a it's a it's a thing it's a thing
53:54
mutant seven foot tall guys looking for things that are suspicious yes yes
54:01
we're all for it okay this would be investigation
54:07
or yeah it's already in the chat okay oh okay
54:12
well I gotta do you try to make it easy people all you gotta do is hit the die roll
54:18
yeah all you gotta do is hit the diagram okay and this is normal and
54:23
boom all right so what what what is Hamlin Define as
54:32
suspicious um I don't know somebody paying undue
54:37
attention to Ursula or uh to us or
54:42
or uh you know someone I should be looking at you know I feel like
54:51
so with the 17 you see a lot of Shifty eyes
54:57
clearly at least a portion of the the patrons of this Clinic did did not end
55:05
up here at this time of day by living a safe lifestyle oh yeah yeah you know
55:10
what I mean yeah um but you don't feel like any of that is directed specifically at you okay all
55:18
right it's it's more of a I've walked into a tough bar right kind of alive all
55:24
right um you you've got like I said you've got a guy with a broken bottle jammed into his eye that he's just using the bottle
55:31
to pool the blood so he's kind of doing this as the bottle
55:38
kind of like because it's elevated it can't quite fill up right but you see it kind of like pulse every so often which
55:45
you assume it's the heartbeat okay um
55:51
particularly pleased with life but right I got you did anybody else do that last uh die
55:58
roll I didn't I want to say I did but I don't didn't
56:04
pay that much attention to it I like watching the dice roll so I don't know what's going on but I I mean it did
56:12
it did for me and then it's just got this little this is a a message box that I haven't seen before so it's it's kind
56:19
of new did everybody see that yeah yeah I saw that right well that that was me rolling to see whether the party lives
56:26
so you know Seth
56:34
yeah unless there's anything else like I said you you you this is a rough neighborhood a ref Ward as it is
56:43
um so I I guess Hamlin would be wary knowing that these are people who
56:50
have a steady diet of violence in their life and would not be hesitant
56:57
to fight back should the need arise but none of them currently looking like
57:03
they're going to start anything all right I'll uh I'll bend down to the child
57:09
who's got the compound fracture and see if he's doing okay and uh I don't know
57:15
if there's any medical uh I'm not going to use my my lay on hands here in front
57:21
of everybody well there is medical skill if you have it I I mean I have it but
57:27
it's not like it's not a skill skill you could look at it and you because you
57:36
don't have a uh a healer's kit yeah you actually
57:41
you don't have any way to like set and bind this wound with clean cloth
57:48
and splints or anything like that but you could perhaps uh make a medical role
57:55
and and determine like maybe ease his pain or
58:01
something like that it's it's obvious that this kid is I mean it's a compound fracture right he is in no small amount
58:09
of pain but he's he's desperately trying to hide it from his mother who is
58:15
clearly panicking okay all right
58:21
um no there's not much I can do that public huh how about roll publicly oh is there a oh
58:28
okay let me roll that again then yeah just so that we can all see it
58:34
because you actually got it hidden because you're logged in as a DM you you can hide your rolls okay it said
58:42
self roll is what it was yeah so with with a 19
58:47
um you could probably um you do see the the various parts that
58:55
you could use to probably set the kid's leg and you're reasonably confident in
59:01
your ability to do so but it would be Battlefield combat medicine okay do I
59:08
I'm not going to do any damage to him by doing this no no no with a role like that you you know that you can set it
59:15
and he he you won't [ __ ] him okay all right so I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna look at her and say let me see what I
59:21
can do uh for him and uh I will uh have
59:27
a uh two gold in my hand when I take her hand and I will put it in the palm of
59:33
her hand when I when I you know when I when I take her hand you know take her hand and tell her let me see what I can do to
59:40
help you and so I put two gold in her hand and uh and then I'll I'll dress his
59:45
wound all right so you you proceed to
59:50
um to to like you use a broken chair that's in the waste bin for the the splint and
59:57
you use some of your extra clothing uh you know rags and whatnot that you
1:00:03
you might carry around just for just in case kind of a deal um and you you proceed to bind it okay
1:00:14
yeah because you're trying to to keep everyone else from seeing that you're slipping some money okay
1:00:22
nice so she she's and I kind of make her I
1:00:28
kind of make her I kind of I make I make it so she closes her hand on it and doesn't look at it
1:00:34
and then Pat then Pat then Pat her the back of her hand and and say everything's gonna be okay
1:00:42
uh you can see the obvious surprise on her face but it's It's Quickly replaced with a hard knowing look uh of someone
1:00:51
who has lived in poverty and is not going to let anyone take okay
1:00:58
all right okay you would never fight if you tried to take it back right I got
1:01:04
you okay well that's that's all I wanted to that's okay I turn around and and kind of bless her you know kind of make
1:01:11
a I don't want to make a big show but just you know bless you and and then we'll I think it's time to go
1:01:19
so Maximus and uh Hamlin come out in in time to see the
1:01:27
party coming up along the the wall to meet them in the pre-arranged spot uh the walk along the wall other than
1:01:34
the mob was uneventful but um one thing that surprised you probably especially surprising to dewin who does
1:01:42
not come to this District um is the number of homeless camps and
1:01:49
hovels um that are are obviously temporary shelters
1:01:55
uh built up along the the foot of the wall for the people that are so poor that
1:02:03
even they can't even afford to live in the poor District they have to it's it's the cardboard box
1:02:09
equivalent never mind um it's
1:02:14
100 in San Francisco somehow I knew I knew that was gonna come up
1:02:22
anywhere in California anywhere is it that bad everywhere
1:02:27
oh yeah yeah it kind of is
1:02:33
um but yeah you've got a lot of it and it totally depends on how to win
1:02:39
responds to it or if at all but yeah it's a a sharp change of pace from the
1:02:47
rest of the city which let's be honest isn't like a Bastion of cleanliness and
1:02:54
good smells it is a medieval city without indoor plumbing uh and it's more
1:02:59
of a a drainage system to the the underdark sewers
1:03:05
um but all the other awards are are probably you know reasonably clean for a
1:03:13
fantasy City and and reasonably clean of smells
1:03:20
um whereas this particular Ward just by fickle fate and and location which is
1:03:28
probably why this Ward is is not desirable the the normal sea breezes
1:03:33
that would blow away any foul smells or are stagnant over this particular Ward
1:03:40
just by a cruel trick of geography
1:03:47
so the wind is is surprised but but you know how you react is up to you
1:03:55
so the the party has gathered up
1:04:00
uh it is getting late in the evening it's now about 8 P.M
1:04:07
um what is the party going to do
1:04:18
well what what is a long-term goal again here so you're in this District looking for
1:04:26
leads and clues as to where this artifact is preferably
1:04:33
before your opponents get it okay and remind me of our our leads again
1:04:42
she said that it was believed to have been found and brought into the city
1:04:49
but she doesn't know where or who that person is only that
1:04:54
the the rumors and information that she gathered was this artifact is loose
1:05:01
that it has been seen by people that that haven't seen it firsthand but have
1:05:07
enough enough trust and and skill that she does believe that it's it's worth
1:05:13
paying you know 6 000 gold pieces out uh to a party of adventurers to go
1:05:20
investigate um that
1:05:26
strange things were being reported in the trades Ward which makes her believe
1:05:33
that with the clues that she was able to to dig up that it is most likely in this
1:05:39
District um and ask for you to come and investigate
1:05:44
um you did get some rumors um specifically cese got rumors
1:05:51
um related to urza urza the cunning in fact
1:05:57
uh specifically mentioning that this artifact is a is an eye it's a sculpture
1:06:03
of an eye um and specifically that that she had been muttering about an eye and and not
1:06:10
going around other people which is what led the party to her okay so it's it's
1:06:16
pretty clear that the eye is definitely here
1:06:22
based on what the party has found just not specifically where
1:06:27
um for sure seems to have had an encounter with it
1:06:34
yeah and we searched her you did you did it was a a one-room
1:06:42
uh hovel slash fortune telling shop okay
1:06:50
well I'll bet some of those mob people would know who was in there with her
1:06:55
they can point us maybe we need to get some from the clinic
1:07:01
no from the the mob that was trying to pit pocket us you said mob and for some reason I
1:07:08
thought organized crime
1:07:18
booked it they've they're gone
1:07:23
they didn't want to get hit by the meteor storm right exactly did we question anybody around the um the area
1:07:31
of Ursula's home we could we could go back and try that
1:07:37
otherwise I don't know if we want to find someplace to sleep for the night and start again in
1:07:44
the morning
1:07:49
sorry it wasn't something about the honorable night yeah The Honorable night is a uh an in
1:07:56
with lodging although I will say that uh to win in in
1:08:02
a case of being the local boy was was wrong and in exactly what the honorable night is
1:08:10
um The Honorable night is actually a 30 foot tall Golem that is no longer
1:08:16
animated in the form of a knight and what happened was is once it was no
1:08:22
longer animated and in was built up along the inside of the shield using that as as part of the back of the
1:08:30
end so that they they didn't have to build a wall
1:08:36
it's cool I thought there was some potential clue
1:08:42
down at the honorable night also there was a um yeah I can find it again and tell you
1:08:50
uh
1:08:55
it was that um some strange folks have been seeing around an abandoned tenant
1:09:01
tenement Southwest of The Honorable night
1:09:06
um it's listed as being condemned so they shouldn't be there um and then the rumor went on to say
1:09:13
that if they didn't know better they would assume it was some sort of Thieves Guild or gang setting up
1:09:20
we could head down to the honorable night stay the night there and then start
1:09:26
probing around uh asking trying to see if there's any clues down there
1:09:35
well you know the honorable night is a it's like a
1:09:40
I think it's like an abandoned tenement right isn't that what you said no no no right I said there's an abandoned
1:09:47
tenement near the The Honorable night s
1:09:53
it is we stayed there and there's a risk right uh I will throw out
1:10:02
that the honorable night is at least uh along a major Street and close enough
1:10:08
anyway and it's on the edge of the the ward so um while it is a rough neighborhood a
1:10:15
perhaps bad neighborhood it's like not the worst part of it
1:10:21
I thought we we ended um staying at the honorable night you said there were only three rooms left
1:10:26
and we had to figure out who was staying with who and my misremembering that you're I think you're misremembering
1:10:32
because we definitely ended the last game with uh the mob forming up yeah
1:10:38
that was Pepperidge Farm or whatever yeah that was Pepperidge family
1:10:45
well that's my suggestion I'm I'm okay
1:10:52
and that's going to be any better ideas that's my suggestion I don't know where when we have
1:10:58
really no other Clues to go on it's it's eight o'clock so all right
1:11:03
like I said I'm open to other ideas I had a question uh Mike so yeah have we
1:11:11
seen a picture of the thing or no a picture of the artifact no the the only
1:11:19
description you have is is that uh it's roughly the size of like a large
1:11:24
watermelon and it is an eye it's believed to be a sculpture perhaps
1:11:31
Stone perhaps not does anybody have any like uh
1:11:39
spells or powers that aren't able to see things
1:11:45
um I have locate objects but the only thing is it has to be something that's familiar to me right
1:11:57
okay well then if you got any other ideas
1:12:04
doesn't sound like it so let's I guess we'll go down to the honorable night and get a place to stay and get up in the
1:12:10
morning down to the honorable night um you're a little late but
1:12:16
um they do have some rooms available and some supper still on the spit it's it's not as fresh as it was when it was
1:12:22
cooked but it's still edible um the the price is going to be a gold person gold piece per person for the
1:12:31
stay and the food um but it will get you all um they they have a suite available as
1:12:38
of sorts that has a a private uh sitting room usually used for merchants but since
1:12:45
it's not in use they offer that is you've got a larger party and that that sitting room has some bedrooms off off
1:12:52
of it that works for us I'm gonna I'll take a gold piece off all right
1:13:00
anybody knows have any contacts within the
1:13:05
Awards within the city that will help us locate anything like this
1:13:13
but wouldn't doing uh he's only he's the only local right
1:13:20
yeah the contacts I have are with the temple of mystra and if we bring it up to them they may
1:13:26
want to get involved if we're in a dining hall ish you know
1:13:33
sitting where everybody else is eating we have a privacy if someone has has any
1:13:39
information from the bartender so when you guys you're gonna eat in the
1:13:45
common room is what I'm hearing so as you guys sit down with your your
1:13:51
meal and and a beer or perhaps a glass of wine um doing you you kind of look to the
1:13:57
side a little bit and you see two guys just hard eye contact
1:14:03
they're they're both like literally turned in their chair to watch your group
1:14:10
when you when you notice them they actually raise a toast and then keep
1:14:15
eating while watching you [Laughter] specifically did to win
1:14:22
yeah Duane was the one who noticed it all right
1:14:30
I'll lean over in uh point out the two guys that are
1:14:35
casing us I tell a party about it so that they can
1:14:41
be cleared in do you have any rank or tabards or do they just no no they just
1:14:47
look like common bobs I suggested doing that he go over and
1:14:54
maybe buy him a couple of ales and talk to him
1:15:01
and we'll be watching his back it was it go over there to those two
1:15:07
guys and see if you can get any information I'll always send the most fragile person
1:15:12
to make initial contact that's always a wife
1:15:19
they seem to know you and I guess you don't generally toast or cheer somebody they don't like so or respect I'm
1:15:26
assuming I can walk over with you and even if they were you gotta you got pretty good backup yeah
1:15:33
I I could be within uh I could be within mug chucking distance
1:15:38
[Laughter]
1:15:44
my sense is from what their actions is they're not looking to hurt you and they might even know you or respect you or
1:15:50
something so all right Mike so I'll go I'll go over
1:15:55
but I'll maintain a modest distance from them sure close enough to converse but
1:16:02
not so close that uh and as you approach they give up the the pretense of having
1:16:08
a meal and say well met to win
1:16:14
like do I know you oh no you don't know us but we know you
1:16:20
or we know of you anyway
1:16:26
we know what you're looking for you should know you know the temple of
1:16:34
mystra like you always work for the temple of
1:16:41
mystra you and that floppish friend who got ripped in half
1:16:47
all right floppish friend that he was a little bit flamboyant
1:16:58
he corrects it he corrects it he corrects him in the middle of their speech Oh you mean fopish oh yes
1:17:08
fabulous I ripped in half
1:17:15
that's I'm sorry what did they say before that uh just that they know who you are they
1:17:20
know who you're working for and they know what you're here for
1:17:25
I don't know I'll play along what am I looking for the eye
1:17:34
oh are you looking for it too indeed
1:17:39
what yeah well I just found who hired you
1:17:45
who says we were hired yeah I just found something on the floor over here oh why
1:17:51
are you looking for it then same reason everyone does power oh
1:17:56
ambition rulership not for us of course for someone far
1:18:04
better oh
1:18:11
well that's too bad they're not paying you our payment comes in other forms
1:18:17
not everyone craves gold oh
1:18:26
well maybe maybe we should trade notes indeed why don't you tell us what you know
1:18:32
they actually take out a pen and paper at this point wow they got a video recorder
1:18:40
I said well unfortunately we we seem to be out of leads we'll just follow you until you get one
1:18:47
then oh okay well it's good to know you got her back
1:18:54
then oh we'll be watching your backs closely
1:19:00
very good all right I didn't catch your name again I know
1:19:06
oh
1:19:11
all right well it's too bad I can't really buy you around if I don't know your names
1:19:16
no it's fine
1:19:25
good luck then I'm sure we'll be seeing you should look like fighter types or just
1:19:31
general scumbags just general scumbags all right are you returning to the table
1:19:37
at this time uh yeah I'll go back yeah and I'll I'll uh relay whatever the
1:19:43
party didn't hear I'll relay it back to them I'd like to propose that
1:19:50
um we waterboard them yes exactly that we set up a uh
1:19:57
set up a little um ambush of them and not not to hurt them but you're trying to extract
1:20:03
information is there a stable Outback there there is
1:20:09
uh no stable sorry cattle frauds yeah
1:20:15
I mean they have cattle they have broads but not cattle prods like you're thinking of
1:20:20
a few minutes after you as you're discussing this the uh the waitress comes around with a round of Ales
1:20:27
for the party and starts sitting them down in front of you when you look up the the one that you
1:20:33
were talking to to win is actually giving you this big shit-eating grin and finger guns
1:20:40
oh my God [Laughter]
1:20:46
so is there no one that can go over there and start a fight and make it look like they started it
1:20:52
uh [Laughter]
1:20:59
you mean like someone's fall into their table and
1:21:07
I don't have good acting skills I will say that you you did not see any
1:21:13
obvious armor or weapons on them when you walked over dual powered
1:21:19
okay no no knives no armor no Shields no swords no bows or anything like that
1:21:27
is
1:21:33
they even have feet well as we drink our ales and discuss
1:21:39
options we could either attempt to
1:21:44
pay them for me for some information if they might have it or we could
1:21:50
what's up everybody eat it out of them
1:21:55
or we could do nothing and assume they they don't don't know much and don't and
1:22:00
just go to bed but what is your sense uh doing is there a sense that they may not have any
1:22:06
information you certainly knew a whole lot more about us than we know about them so I
1:22:12
agree so do we want do we want to take a soft approach
1:22:19
um of offering paying them from information or do we want I mean we don't know how
1:22:24
much longer these guys are going to be around I it sounds to me like they're motivated
1:22:29
by money and it sounds to me like they don't know I put in a Ziploc
1:22:34
and they're hoping that maybe by following us around um we'll lead them to the eye and then they can jump us and take it from us
1:22:41
after we're you know done securing it yeah
1:22:46
and we don't really want them following us around anyway so maybe we do
1:22:55
take them and tie them up and try to beat something out of them and then at
1:23:01
least um leave them you know leave them in there you know in an area where they're not going to be
1:23:07
following us around does the does the popo uh come around
1:23:13
here very often in this tavern uh you would imagine so but you haven't
1:23:19
seen them yet uh the police would I shouldn't say please the guard would do
1:23:24
regular patrols even at night even in this District um and they would surely make stops at
1:23:32
businesses that are open into the night especially ones that serve alcohol
1:23:38
you don't know how often they're here though it's just public I think for
1:23:43
interrogation that's
1:23:49
I'm gonna find um maybe I'm going to look for um is there an in is there like an
1:23:55
Innkeeper like like specifically an Innkeeper but
1:24:01
the bartender is the one who handles the the room rentals and some of the orders
1:24:06
at the bar and then there's two waitresses that are going around uh serving meals and drinks
1:24:16
okay um I'm gonna go up to the bartender I'm gonna ask him um
1:24:21
if the two gentlemen um I would ask um if the two gentlemen
1:24:26
haven't paid for their rooms since I'm I'm assuming they're spending another night I'd like to pay for their rooms
1:24:32
oh no they they've already paid up they they came in a little bit before you did in fact oh so they are staying the night
1:24:44
Maximus is the one talking but yeah unless you're gonna come over or shout at him
1:24:49
yeah right I mean really all I wanted to know was get you got the information that they are staying the night they are
1:24:55
yeah they well they have rooms they have they have rooms okay find out what their name is
1:25:01
uh I'd like to um write those gentlemen to
1:25:08
personalized card you happen to know their names the names
1:25:15
well there's no register where they sign in
1:25:20
but um that's a bit modern but he does say well one said his name was Johann
1:25:26
Schmidt and the other one said his name was John Smith John Smith and John Smith okay
1:25:34
John Doe and John Doe um okay all right well I returned to the
1:25:40
table I let everybody know that it appears they are staying the night by the way this is at the moment when
1:25:46
the party is is drinking and chatting that they realize that you've been drinking the beers that were bought for you by the The Smiths
1:25:57
did I drink did I drink mine yeah you guys said you were drinking your your beers all right now we're all drugged up
1:26:04
damn it now we're roofy yeah well you don't know that it's just kind of one of
1:26:09
those like you sit down after taking the last drink out of the the mug and like
1:26:15
oh wait I was thinking we shouldn't drink those
1:26:20
ales but all right well they are brought to you by the waitress they were brought to you
1:26:27
brought to you by the waitress um it's it's the the grin with finger guns that kind of
1:26:34
makes you go oh oh hey
1:26:39
but you you feel fine can we get a room next to those guys
1:26:45
uh you've already got the room with the uh the suite oh okay
1:26:55
all right well we could wait for them to go to sleep
1:27:00
are you doing this discussion like in the common room or in the the suite
1:27:06
uh we're still in the common room drinking right and eating well I I'm making sure yeah
1:27:15
I think any further discussion about our friends could not be good enough for you
1:27:22
well I'm gonna suggest that some of us go up to the suite and barricade it and
1:27:28
some of us stay down and follow these guys to their room
1:27:34
okay well at least keep in mind I have low intelligence compared to everybody else in here
1:27:44
well I was going to say you know if if those drinks are drugged
1:27:49
um I probably could cast some sort of right some
1:27:54
restoration lesser restoration that solve
1:28:01
uh incapacitation due to drugs you want a perception check is that what you want
1:28:07
I do is it based on sight
1:28:13
uh uh sure but um I I don't have a token for your your
1:28:20
Hawk all right I'll just let me let me drag one in let me let me do that okay
1:28:25
everybody roll perception yeah everybody it's in the uh it's in the the log over
1:28:31
there okay yeah you should get a little prompt sound when Mike does that
1:28:37
yeah I did or I didn't I didn't but that's okay as long as he tells me
1:28:54
Galen Derwin and and myself are the only ones that didn't make it
1:28:59
foreign so I rolled I didn't see a die but
1:29:04
yeah I'm the same way I saw my results yeah all right I never saw a die roll
1:29:12
you may have uh essay since you rolled the high note um as you guys are talking and saying
1:29:18
that you're gonna take this up you actually glance over and there you swear
1:29:23
to God they are transposing your conversation
1:29:32
they're transcribing all of your conversation and they're they're not being shy about
1:29:39
it I mean can they hear us like if in a natural
1:29:45
way are they hearing us are there or well enough anyway
1:29:50
but they're not exactly too far away I wish we had a better clue
1:30:02
all right well so I added a hawk um Howard it should be owned by you
1:30:09
and I will try and make sure to include that in the next uh next roll request
1:30:14
let me try and do it right now
1:30:22
yeah looks like it works so if you want to roll and get Advantage from it
1:30:28
um it doesn't prompt me or give me a dice oh it it should be owned by you
1:30:36
hell I can roll it if you're a gay Master that's not true
1:30:42
assistant but I can just do it I can so I just go up here and just do uh
1:30:48
this and this I can do it from its characters yeah
1:30:57
so anyway kind of independently noticed that that
1:31:02
the two Johns are are actively recording your conversation as you as you talk
1:31:09
so have they been hearing us plotting to get information from them and give them
1:31:14
up they they've been recording the whole thing because you guys have been sitting in this comment room where they've been
1:31:19
actively watching you in this case
1:31:26
we wouldn't be talking about them in a manner which we they could normally hear them
1:31:31
I'm assuming that you would be trying to speak low but here you still have to speak loud enough for the the people to
1:31:37
hear hear you so they they may only get 50 but
1:31:44
yeah it doesn't take much to figure oh they played on kidnapping beating us and
1:31:50
leaving us tied up yeah okay
1:31:56
um I I can I use pressure presentation to light their notes on fire
1:32:03
uh does it work can it set like like fires it uh snap out of candle uh you can
1:32:11
light or snuff out a candle torch or small campfire you could light it on fire but there's no guarantee that it's
1:32:17
gonna like emulate right away they can Pat it out
1:32:24
well yeah but I can still send a message yeah sure yeah you totally you can do that
1:32:31
okay I I'm just showing him that I'm annoyed yep
1:32:38
so there's no role for that so and it's a can trips there's no spell slot so you
1:32:44
you set their their current notes on fire and they they pad it out and go that was
1:32:50
rude yeah I think eavesdropping is also rude
1:32:55
it's a public room we can listen to whatever we want
1:33:01
well and at the public room I can light on fire whatever I want yeah
1:33:08
until the Barking objects
1:33:15
does anybody have like uh some spell of invisibility or something
1:33:20
or uh anyway yeah if it even has invisibility and even if they did it would be a
1:33:27
single person not a group yeah I know what I was actually thinking of us
1:33:32
retiring back through our suite and then one person just finding out what room they're in
1:33:39
and then I thought maybe you're not saying this right no I'm not saying this out loud
1:33:47
I'm whispering it we all know that that's what they're doing right
1:33:54
what's that what we're all aware that they're doing that at this point oh yeah they're they're
1:33:59
they're not hiding it at all what are we doing why don't we go ahead and finish our meals and our drinks and
1:34:06
um go back to our room and um talk about what we're gonna do
1:34:14
all right so as soon as I'm done with my meal I'm going to Ritual cast alarm over all the
1:34:21
entries and exits to uh our room does that have a range
1:34:26
alarmed yeah does it do a range or is it like an area of effect is what I mean
1:34:34
uh yeah so uh here I'll help uh no larger than a 20-foot Cube so
1:34:40
you wouldn't be able to get um you would be able to get like the front door so the the the sweet area
1:34:48
that you have is like one of those business suites with like a meeting living room area
1:34:54
so would you come into the suite you're in the like a living room area and then there's bedrooms off of it
1:35:01
so you wouldn't be able to get everything
1:35:06
no I'm saying I would cast multiple alarms and different things so you're
1:35:12
gonna do this ritual like several times well I mean how many how many entrances
1:35:18
to the suite are there well there's the main room and then each bedroom has a window
1:35:27
wow okay so I guess I'm gonna spend about an hour casting alarm
1:35:32
do we all have to be in the room before before you cast on
1:35:38
I think he can determine like creatures that won't set off the alarm
1:35:43
yeah I can designate up to
1:35:53
it doesn't say so I'm just gonna say the party
1:36:03
it just says you could designate creatures that won't set off the alarm well so I'm going to set the party in
1:36:09
the gate and yep all right
1:36:16
so you you set alarm and then uh and then you guys are going to have your
1:36:21
discussions is that the plan yes
1:36:27
all right so an hour goes by uh of you
1:36:32
know burning sage bundles and and hey uh while he's casting this ritual I will
1:36:38
tear you in the common room and take a long time to drink my ale
1:36:45
okay drink you know drink but take a long time to drink the same drink
1:36:52
sure they actually offer to buy you another
1:37:00
so he comes over to me yeah I mean he's not like up in your face but
1:37:06
he approaches your table and says can I get you another you seem thirsty big man
1:37:14
boy have a seat what was that have to see sure I just I just wish we had someone
1:37:21
on our party would go what did you call my mother and just [Laughter]
1:37:28
have a seat tell me yeah he has to see tell me of your travels
1:37:35
oh we've been many places deserts on the sea
1:37:41
mountains of course but lately here
1:37:47
tell me more what's the talent we we both serve a God
1:37:52
we know we know what servitude is like tell me of your God
1:37:59
oh my God doesn't like to be discussed
1:38:05
okay I look at him confused
1:38:13
what what is what is handling confused about I just look at him confused when he said my God does not wish to be
1:38:19
spoken of right he's not necessarily offering anything
1:38:25
more oh okay literally he's saying my God doesn't
1:38:31
like me to talk about you oh
1:38:37
or he chooses not to talk about his guide among non-believers oh
1:38:43
same result either way your God does not wish to proselytize
1:38:50
he has no need of such things tell me what the person needed
1:38:58
he needs an eye he finds himself wanting his his minus and I
1:39:05
no he finds himself wanting he wants one he wants what I
1:39:11
yeah go ahead and roll that persuasion check okay
1:39:17
oh you put it up there I see I still didn't get the uh I still didn't get the notification
1:39:28
all right so you you do pass a persuasion check but not by a lot so just tell me what you're trying to get
1:39:35
out of him I've tried to get an idea of of you know who
1:39:40
who he who he follows or who he's working for or you know maybe I should have rolled
1:39:46
inside I don't know well because you're you're discussing it with him so you're trying you're
1:39:52
definitely trying to persuade him to tell you information yeah uh insight's much more passive yep
1:40:02
um so over the course of about 15 minutes uh 15 20 minutes or so
1:40:07
you kind of go back and forth trying to probe to to figure out more
1:40:13
about who he serves and while you you don't come out with a name you
1:40:19
definitely feel that based on the responses based on the
1:40:26
occasional hints uh where John Smith was feeling clever
1:40:32
but not quite clever enough to to obscure the meetings
1:40:37
um you do feel like he is working for uh some some form of dark shadowy cult
1:40:48
um you're not sure you're not sure if it's an actual God
1:40:54
that they serve or whether it's an ideology
1:41:03
not every cult has a god behind it in other words okay and they carry no mystic symbols no
1:41:11
tattoos no none visible
1:41:17
well I want to drop the hint that that I have not been with these people
1:41:22
that I I am I'm new to to this area drop a hint drop just just just drop a
1:41:28
hint you know yeah yeah um and the response to oh boy sorry go
1:41:35
ahead no no no that's that's just I want to see what their reaction is to that well if if
1:41:42
these are not truly or your traveling companions well perhaps we could work together
1:41:51
and he's he puts 10 gold on the table under his hand
1:41:59
Perhaps Perhaps you would be amendable you you seemed like you've had a hard
1:42:05
life perhaps fate hasn't been as kind to you as you
1:42:12
would like it to be in fact
1:42:18
and he reaches into a pouch and pulls out a grape-sized emerald
1:42:25
and puts it on the table next to him next next to the gold
1:42:30
perhaps we can strike a deal
1:42:37
I'm listening you seem like someone that once once an oath is sworn you would
1:42:42
abide by it I too would abide by an oath sworn
1:42:52
perhaps we can see eye to eye on these matters I I sort of just kind of himself
1:43:00
[Laughter]
1:43:07
because he got the book with him is he the one with the book no it is his partner had it and the the
1:43:14
Johann is already left the room oh he didn't tell me that okay I just was
1:43:19
trying you spent 20 minutes like trying to to wheel information out of John and
1:43:25
Johan left I got you
1:43:32
well I can swear no oath if I knew nothing about you follow
1:43:39
I do not step blindly it doesn't have to be anything quite so dramatic
1:43:44
simply give an oath to Adas if if such Aid is needed
1:43:50
we won't ask you to kill your friends we won't ask you to slay in a sense
1:43:57
merely give a friend a hand oh surely you can swear that
1:44:04
no I know nothing of you you have given me nothing we are not friends I have presented you
1:44:11
with golden gems so this means friendship to you I thought many was not uh what you
1:44:18
worshiped I wasn't referring to money for myself
1:44:26
Perhaps it is not money that I work with either perhaps not what can we offer you oh boy
1:44:37
perhaps you wish and he examines you a little bit closer legitimacy
1:44:43
yeah I I see you're holy symbol
1:44:48
is is true but poor quality for a man of your size
1:44:57
perhaps we can help you with that perhaps
1:45:03
we might be able to assist with any issues you have with the church
1:45:09
of ill Manor clearly you have been roughly treated by
1:45:14
them they would never leave one of their own a Believer a devout follower
1:45:21
who professes his faith openly then you misunderstand no matter
1:45:28
oh I think I I know of ill met her the belief that there is finite
1:45:34
suffering in the world and that he wishes to take it all upon himself and his followers
1:45:42
are you are you one that that suffers willingly hoping that it reduces
1:45:48
the burdens of others we certainly could transfer some of that
1:45:55
suffering on you wish he he just laughs in your face ah you
1:46:03
you make such good jests
1:46:10
well you will not tell me where you travel
1:46:17
and who you travel with I do not we call each other I do not
1:46:22
thank you for calling each other friends what what do you know about the people
1:46:29
that you currently travel with do you call them friends do you know where they've traveled
1:46:35
it does not matter exactly it does not matter so why do you
1:46:41
resist my offer
1:46:46
I don't resist it ah did we have a deal no
1:46:55
you were a man confused with your own self aren't you I pity [Laughter]
1:47:08
I go with the whims of um he pulls back the money sadly I see that
1:47:15
there is no bargain to be struck [Music] your payment is not one that's a is
1:47:22
something that could buy me or it simply was an insufficient amount
1:47:28
either way true
1:47:35
I wonder if your other friends will be as amenable
1:47:40
perhaps they would like pretty gems I laugh at his sweets
1:47:47
what's that I laugh and it switched baubles children's baubles
1:47:55
these are what you deal in this is what human beings are worth
1:48:00
to you it's we're far more than most human beings look around most of these people
1:48:07
would would knife their mother for half this amount it's very possible
1:48:14
it seems that you uh feed on suffering
1:48:19
not at all suffering is not my goal foreign but I ask you this follower of
1:48:27
Elementor how can you end the suffering and consume all of it when new suffering is
1:48:34
born with every child's breath suffering is eternal it will never end
1:48:42
but it's certainly suffering and we offer an option to lessen the
1:48:48
suffering I'm all ears once everyone is under our control there
1:48:57
will be no no loose suffering it's simple he wanted to say it he wanted to say it
1:49:04
Mike he wanted to say it did I catch anything did I catch
1:49:10
anything you heard what you heard okay
1:49:17
all right he's not the one with a notebook and uh okay
1:49:25
oh well I bid you pleasant dreams indeed
1:49:33
I get up and good night to you of Sir Knight
1:49:40
all right I get up and I go towards the room I look for I look for his friend
1:49:46
as I know you don't see him out in the hall okay not skulking around somewhere
1:49:53
yeah okay all right I'll head up to the room and uh give them the little bit of
1:50:01
insight that I got from our our friend who wishes to buy anyone and everyone from the party that
1:50:08
they can uh so that they wish to prey on on any kind of weakness that any one of us has
1:50:18
he offered me a fist-sized gem a fist size emerald and and was it 10 gold
1:50:24
it was a great size oh grape size Emerald I'm sorry a grape size emerald in in like 10 gold
1:50:30
yes he offered me offered me more than that
1:50:37
but but it was all just taught so he's just looking for a weakness
1:50:48
still didn't find out where he's from other than we obviously know he's working for some kind of dark shadowy
1:50:53
cult but would refuse to uh oh would be oh okay it's Brad's back or
1:51:01
when we lost we didn't lose anybody okay all right uh
1:51:07
so he works for a dark shadowy cult but he refuses to name this uh this cult or
1:51:12
anything other than he says then once everyone is under control of this
1:51:20
people or entity or whatever then they will the suffering in the world will be lessened
1:51:26
all right I'm tired of these guys let's find out where their room is and sneak in and uh beat the crap out of him
1:51:34
um does anybody does anybody having like truth truth CRM spells or anything like that [Laughter]
1:51:41
so it's at this point when you hear a knock on the floor and a muffled speak up we can't hear you
1:51:49
very well uh they're just gonna not leave us alone
1:51:55
tonight are they that's convenient
1:52:01
now we know which room they're in
1:52:07
so they're next to us they were knocking they were like broom
1:52:14
on the ceiling kind of video
1:52:22
we'll knock back and say uh sleep tight
1:52:28
hit the reply back after the delay is better than you will
1:52:34
all right this is
1:52:40
why don't we uh why don't we uh have somebody stand guard we'll get a couple
1:52:46
hours sleep and then we'll walk at least I'll get up and maybe whoever wants to
1:52:53
go with me and there's just two of them right that you know us that we know of yeah
1:52:58
who's who's sleeping and who's taking watch um I think since I'm gonna go down and
1:53:04
be an Intimidator obviously whoever's not going to go down and intimidate right we could we could all just go to
1:53:11
sleep we haven't all the entrances are alarmed and the Hawkins are like all right that's right
1:53:17
okay all right well let's just go to sleep and I only want to meditate yeah that's true
1:53:26
I'll be right back yep so I think we get uh two hour two or
1:53:32
three hours sleep and then I will volunteer to go down and um
1:53:39
do we have do we have a locksmith uh or uh there is no Rogues in the party
1:53:48
where's Ray when you need him I know I really um
1:53:56
it might be a little noisy if I break down the door right so anybody any other thoughts
1:54:03
definitely not subtle you can skip the hawk I I grabbed too
1:54:11
many I didn't
1:54:16
oh can we get the key from the bartender Maybe
1:54:23
he's not gonna willingly give it to you you might be able to bribe the bartender
1:54:28
but he's not likely to give it to you not willingly
1:54:34
um simply because it's the honorable night and he doesn't want to hurt the reputation of his establishment
1:54:42
foreign
1:54:49
for us and I need the Constitution roles from
1:54:54
from everybody else everybody but me
1:55:01
everybody but you yeah because you're you're you don't really need to sleep
1:55:12
thank you uh silly well Matt's not here so I'm
1:55:18
just going to roll it for him um and uh I need one from Brad uh sorry Jason
1:55:25
you need a constitutional for me I do
1:55:32
sorry it's been a while uh okay I see if I have one
1:55:40
cool cool thank you all right so you you guys are gonna sleep for a
1:55:46
couple hours um the entire time you're trying to sleep that they're they're making noise
1:55:53
like scraping things along their ceiling talking to you through the floor like oh
1:56:00
it's such a really nice day out today wasn't it uh just basically everything that they
1:56:07
can to be annoying uh and you guys are gonna try so because
1:56:12
of that uh the people that did not succeed the saving throw which is
1:56:19
uh everybody but uh imaco and Hamlin
1:56:24
uh you actually got no sleep at this point
1:56:30
you you know every time you started to drift off there was a noise or an interruption
1:56:36
that just it's it's the dripping faucet that just can't be ignored
1:56:41
so um but but you know Hamlin and emiko
1:56:47
sleep like babies for the the two or three hours or however long it's going to be yep
1:56:56
so uh so it's like this is I can't sleep yep I'm I might as well do something
1:57:02
while I'm awake I'm on a ritual cast unseen servant sure
1:57:08
go ahead and throw that up so I can yeah
1:57:15
what is that I guess
1:57:28
all right so what are you gonna have it do well I can send it up to 60 feet away
1:57:35
right uh you you do but it does uh it occupies physical space
1:57:42
oh yeah it's not like a ghost so you you can send it 60 feet away but it would
1:57:47
have to use like all the normal physical rules like doors and stairs and whatnot oh I know I was gonna have it I was
1:57:55
going to have a climb down the outside of the building and go and uh all right and what form of of alarm did
1:58:03
you use like audible or mental uh I I use the audible alarm got it
1:58:12
all right so you said the Unseen servant out your window and the alarm immediately goes off
1:58:19
because you did not exclude the Unseen servant from the alarm spell
1:58:25
right so so [Music]
1:58:30
now even the people that did fall asleep are now awake
1:58:36
misery loves company yeah so to catch you up Matt when you were
1:58:42
gone wow the party decided to sleep for a bit and then uh like two or three
1:58:47
hours and then sneak out and go after the the Johns yeah
1:58:53
um but as you guys bed down they are constantly like talking to you through
1:58:58
the floor scraping things on the ceiling uh and it is like the the dripping
1:59:03
faucet that you just can't fall asleep because you hear it dripping
1:59:09
um except you and emico were just sleeping like babies until you got woken
1:59:16
up by an alarm like an hour into it
1:59:22
okay all right so uh are you gonna continue with your uh unseen servant Howard or or
1:59:29
you know you've got this alarm that I assume you turned off not long after it went off actually I think it I think the alarm
1:59:36
spell goes away after it's set off um
1:59:48
[Music]
1:59:54
let's go get these guys so you're you're having it now
2:00:00
I guess it doesn't just keep going so yeah that's fine
2:00:07
the Unseen servant is the one that set it off yeah so Howard there's no like telepathic
2:00:14
link between you and the Unseen servant it can follow your verbal act oh no
2:00:19
mentally command it so it can move 15 feet and interact with
2:00:24
an object up to 60 feet total yeah so it's not very fast it's not very
2:00:31
strong no okay got it
2:00:37
so you're you're commanding it to like climb down the side of uh the building
2:00:43
so to climb down the side of the building go into the room below it below us and
2:00:52
and then just uh mess up the room
2:00:57
so there's no stat block for unseen servant
2:01:03
I don't see here
2:01:10
why don't we have the Unseen servant distract him at the window so the Unseen servant has a strength of
2:01:19
two yeah and it is not proficient so you need to make an Athletics check so it's
2:01:25
a D20 minus four and I'll make the DC-10
2:01:33
let me go ahead I will just I don't know because if I post it to you it's going to be uh
2:01:39
it's gonna want it's going to apply your modifiers so just use a public roll
2:01:45
oh wait I know I know I would do that so 17 minus 413 yeah okay it succeeds in
2:01:53
climbing down uh outside of the building and then uh it
2:02:00
reports back that the window is locked
2:02:05
well I I gave a command to just go in so I assume
2:02:11
[Music] because I don't know that I'm doing it
2:02:18
well it uh it can't attack but it can do simple tasks right but the window is blocked the
2:02:25
window's locked so it could break the window yeah sure I'll let it break the window
2:02:32
um go ahead and uh I won't even require an attack roll although with a two it might not succeed
2:02:40
to be honest it doesn't matter I'm just trying to annoy them
2:02:47
you were trying to go into the room so you're just like at the window tapping on the window or what no it's supposed
2:02:54
to try to break into the room and if it gets the room it's supposed to it's supposed to start to throw things around the room and make a mess
2:03:04
is it invisible yeah it is invisible so um so it it breaks in the window
2:03:11
and you hear things start being tossed around small items of course
2:03:18
um and uh you just hear back oh good move to win
2:03:26
good move but otherwise they don't seem to be
2:03:32
upset about it if anything they congratulated you on
2:03:37
your counter counter boy
2:03:43
what do you say we came and visit
2:03:49
why don't we go down knock on the door and doing once you knock on the door and say
2:03:54
uh you know hey I'd really like to talk about uh the offer I've heard you've been making
2:04:00
we'll have a couple of people we don't want to open the door you're the land shark
2:04:08
I have a couple people outside the door already just storm in once they open the door Sandy Graham
2:04:16
um Pizza
2:04:25
all right so that's what that's what the party's gonna do I I would suggest if we're gonna go with
2:04:31
some kind of deception to get in um probably someone that's a little better
2:04:36
at selling exception would be better
2:04:47
this is my cleric not my bird well breastfeeding already had the
2:04:54
conversation with him downstairs right or not rescued in Hamlin [Laughter]
2:05:00
paper maybe Hamlin's changed his mind and he wants to talk to him
2:05:06
I assume that that's what you're gesturing to the party
2:05:11
yep well I didn't I didn't say that yeah he he's he's
2:05:18
Galen is uh gesturing to the party that you should switch to written communication
2:05:26
all right does does anyone have a writing kit with
2:05:32
paper because they are god-awfully expensive I know um yeah Duane I think just has
2:05:40
like metal etching well I I I I I don't know
2:05:47
I do have ink and parchment and come on I'm a diviner these things are necessary
2:05:57
yeah you also make your spell book out of hammered copper plates so
2:06:02
yeah well I I do things more than just you know spell books I know that that's
2:06:08
why I was teasing you I I I study a lot
2:06:13
I learn about magical items I have to make notes and and
2:06:21
I think you might be the only one so if you're if you're gonna switch
2:06:27
go ahead and mark off a pin or sorry some paper all right uh
2:06:34
parchment
2:06:39
edit item do I just change the number quantity nine will that help yep
2:06:49
and then for the purposes of the game I will consider anything said at this point to be written
2:06:56
okay well we should write out our plan I think our plan I mean they were talking to Hamlin
2:07:04
and maybe Hamlin's changed his mind about their offer and he'd like to go talk to them and knock on their door
2:07:12
I'll be waiting outside and whoever wants to join me and we'll storm in there
2:07:24
rough him up a little bit get some information out of them I'm sure this is by the way a trap
2:07:35
I have a question um yeah go ahead do we know how long
2:07:42
um because I do have um zone of Truth do we know how long that would last
2:07:48
I should say in the spell description it says
2:07:55
let's see
2:08:04
one action foreign
2:08:17
it's right there at the bottom 10 minutes 10 minutes is good
2:08:26
now you do know that it's they they can't speak a deliberate lie they can speak an unintentional lie and they do
2:08:32
get a savings well it seems to me the questions I'm
2:08:40
pointing out for Aaron the details of the spell no it's fine I mean we got nothing right
2:08:46
now anyway an unintentional I mean like if they were misinformed right
2:08:54
or they simply don't know right no that's fine
2:09:00
all right here's um are we on board with this plan I am
2:09:07
all right I'm going down Hamlin's going down so when you when you go to exit the
2:09:14
suite the the door is giving resistance
2:09:21
what
2:09:26
can we determine if it's been locked from the outside it is not locked the the
2:09:33
doorknob mechanism is working free and clear it's the door
2:09:38
itself has resistance okay I'm gonna I'm gonna put my shoulder
2:09:43
into it not like ramming it but just trying right turn the knob and push put
2:09:49
your back into it a little bit yeah
2:09:59
it doesn't do anything let's find out
2:10:08
should I roll that oh strength savings bro okay
2:10:16
let's say that opened it you you put you had to put a little bit more Force into it than you thought and
2:10:22
it finally like tears free almost in slow motion and what you find out is that there's
2:10:29
still a pot of industrial glue in the hallway where they just dumped it into
2:10:36
the seam that the between the jam and the door and just glued the door shut
2:10:44
this is like like wood glue yeah yeah it looks more like a a very
2:10:50
strong rubber cement all right tricksters
2:10:56
I know these guys are I just want to beat the crap out of these guys
2:11:01
um all right so we're we're the doors open yep
2:11:08
all right so I'm going down the other like little uh
2:11:14
home alone like booby traps on our way uh you don't see any obvious ones no
2:11:24
um do I sense Danger not particularly no
2:11:33
but then to be fair the the glued door wouldn't set off danger either because
2:11:38
it's not a damaging trap right I I the only reason I'm asking is
2:11:44
I've got that's one of my ability yep I'm just making sure that we're we're both talking the same same language so
2:11:52
it will detect if something is a threat to your your personal health or safety in other words something that could do
2:11:58
damage or bind to you or or restrain you in some way but it wouldn't for example
2:12:04
protect you against like embarrassment social problems or inconveniences that
2:12:10
neither bind nor damage you
2:12:19
your room all right so
2:12:26
who's going down Hamlin you're going down I'm going down Jalen you're going down yeah what about Amica you've got
2:12:34
some sort of uh true true thing what were you saying you had
2:12:40
I have a spell called zone of truth that we can put them under where they can't
2:12:46
intentionally lie okay well then once you've kind of
2:12:51
follow in the rear and we're going to go down so is
2:12:58
everybody doing going or is Gwen going as well if someone should stay with him he's
2:13:04
frail that's Twiggy
2:13:10
who's gonna pick him up and take him over their need you can come with us and just stay in the back like I'm gonna I
2:13:17
can stay with him since I seem to draw a lot of threats of security guards harassing me so maybe I'll just
2:13:26
he's having flashbacks to his other life at a bar that didn't go well
2:13:36
all right so are you a question are you approaching stealthily or openly as a
2:13:42
party oh I think I think we're um I think I think um is the hallway dark white what's
2:13:50
going on uh it is is dimly lit it it's got
2:13:56
um uh like lanterns but only one per floor
2:14:01
because it's expensive to burn oil all night and dangerous but they they did want some lighting
2:14:09
so it is decidedly dim lighting okay
2:14:15
uh so it is considered dim light all right
2:14:21
gotcha specifically specifically specifically saying dim
2:14:26
light okay gotcha anyway all right I can cast light though no no no
2:14:32
I want it dim okay the answer Mike is
2:14:39
yeah we don't want them to know that there's four or five people coming down just one
2:14:46
was the keyhole on our door large enough that I can see through it
2:14:51
if I look uh on your room um no it's it's not like the the old
2:14:58
home locks where you can peek through and see what the butler's doing um there's a there's the mechanism and a
2:15:05
plate for privacy well um which which makes sense because
2:15:10
um remember that these rooms are typically rented out the Suites that is are typically rented out by traveling
2:15:17
Merchants that want to do business in these rooms okay like their Caravan has arrived and
2:15:23
they're they're trying to negotiate prices with local vendors okay and they
2:15:28
did you wouldn't necessarily want to risk having that information spied on it's the room below us a suite do we
2:15:35
know you don't know yet okay all right I'm going to suggest that I quietly
2:15:43
let's go ahead and do a group uh stealth role and the way I'm going to do this is
2:15:49
I'm going to throw out the the highest role and the lowest role
2:15:56
I was going to suggest that I unless we have someone who's specifically said who specific is stealthy I was
2:16:04
going to go ahead uh well I was asking about is the party party going stealthily or not and I
2:16:12
heard yes okay yes so everybody needs to go ahead and roll
2:16:19
a stealth check all right so I have one thing that tells me I have a disadvantage at stealth and then I have
2:16:25
another one that says I have Advantage itself
2:16:30
uh let me see yeah just like I suspected
2:16:36
so I you probably have a disadvantage yeah you have a disadvantage at stealth because of chain mail yes but I have an
2:16:43
advantage at stealth in dim light due to my cloak
2:16:50
so then it it evens out and you just roll all the way all right will it tell
2:16:55
me that that's what I'm asking um no you yep when you click the normal
2:17:00
it should ask you if you want to roll it at disadvantage or advantage and you just roll it normal okay there you go
2:17:21
oh I don't see any guy rolls maybe there's a setting where where you don't have
2:17:26
animated dice on possibly or it could just be broken but
2:17:32
it definitely shows on my screen it shows the dice rolling
2:17:37
either more this group role I'm throwing out to win's role and I'm throwing out
2:17:43
Marcus's role as the highest so of what's left the highest roll is an 11.
2:17:50
so that's the group stealth role okay all right so you you make your way not
2:17:59
like the night wind but as quiet as you can manage with a group in in heavy armor
2:18:05
um down the hall and you approach the door that should be this week directly under yours
2:18:15
okay what are you gonna do is there uh Hamlin that's gonna
2:18:22
get a little top tap tap on the door and we're going to be kind of out of sight and he's gonna
2:18:28
let him know that you know he's kind of changed his mind based on the discussions they had and do you mind if
2:18:34
I come in and then we're gonna Rush In so let's have you try and do a
2:18:42
persuasion first of all is there a privacy is there a privacy plate in this
2:18:47
Keyhole uh you know you you look through and it
2:18:54
either has a privacy plate or it's dark inside
2:18:59
you you can't tell which I can't I can't see the night the like the moon or
2:19:05
anything through the it's it's yeah it's not facing a window
2:19:11
assuming it's a sweet like what you guys had the windows were in the bedrooms and the entryway went into a like a parlor
2:19:19
type area I can't see anything
2:19:24
you you do still hear SSA that things are still being occasionally thrown
2:19:30
around the room
2:19:35
um so knowing their noise versus the Unseen servants noise I I don't know how
2:19:41
you would accomplish that tell the Unseen servant to light the candle
2:19:46
uh
2:19:52
okay is the Unseen Terran still in there throwing things around yeah it lasts an
2:19:59
hour I know I didn't know if they killed it or not no
2:20:06
okay all right until the Unseen servant to uh
2:20:11
open the door all right [Laughter]
2:20:18
the the room inside is dark okay and there's is there
2:20:27
I just kind of take a look inside there there's well I mean so are you
2:20:33
lighting a torch or what are you doing do you have dark vision no but I'm gonna just kind of see if I notice anything
2:20:40
it's dark you don't see anybody you see a uh the the table has been
2:20:47
dragged more toward the center of the room or I shouldn't say drag because you didn't hear it picked up and carefully
2:20:53
moved um and on the table is a small glass it's about the size of
2:21:02
a uh what do they call them the striker marbles the big marbles
2:21:08
okay um there's one of those on the table there is a cone with hooked to a a box
2:21:17
sitting next to it and you see that
2:21:23
um every so often a pole or a broom handle perhaps Rises up and drags itself
2:21:31
across the ceiling oh so they aren't even here this is this is a this is a like a can trip of some kind or some
2:21:38
uh mechanical magical thing going on because the the broom handle is is
2:21:44
lifting itself right yeah so it's got to be a magic word very
2:21:50
good at it how would they know that the invisible
2:21:58
Serum is in there
2:22:03
that's for you brainiacs to figure out so this is this room is just like the
2:22:10
other rooms our room upstairs uh yeah
2:22:16
okay well again obviously a trap
2:22:22
um and they're not in here to speak so that that that that cone or something that's
2:22:30
how they were emitting their voice a cone with a box at the end at the small end specifically yeah
2:22:37
okay well I guess uh looking around to make sure I don't have anybody that can
2:22:43
sneak up on me yeah sure and uh I'll pick up the box with the cone and on the
2:22:48
end of it okay you you pick it up it's fairly lightweight it feels like it's parchment
2:22:55
the cone the cone is parchment I should say um the Box feels like it's just thin
2:23:01
wood as you pick it up to examine it they say congratulations you found us
2:23:07
ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding comes from the cone okay
2:23:13
clever we thought so with these guys
2:23:19
so if they kind of how can they see all this I don't know uh is that to win or is
2:23:26
that uh that's to win thinking that himself
2:23:36
um there are a number of ways that you can think of that would allow you to see
2:23:41
remotely uh Clairvoyance is the most obvious one
2:23:46
right a lot of magic going on in there yep
2:23:57
okay well I I I have some things that I can
2:24:03
do to counteract some of this but I I don't I don't necessarily see that it would be useful
2:24:08
the the broom handle like comes down and just breaks itself on your armor just
2:24:13
smacks you with it and it just does no damage it just breaks the broom handle all right I'll move my hand through the
2:24:20
air to see if there's anything solid behind it uh I don't think that there is no there
2:24:26
is there is so you you move your hand and you you bump into something I'll grab a hold of it okay
2:24:37
uh it weekly fights against you but like a child has more strength than
2:24:44
this does so like an unseen servant yep okay I'll drag it out into the
2:24:49
hallway and here's here's what's been making all of our noise on the on the floor
2:24:55
it is invisible so you're just kind of pointing to it I I I look at I look at dwind specifically
2:25:05
unseen unseen servant yes why they're doing that I'm searching the
2:25:11
room okay careful there may be other traps uh
2:25:16
let's see excuse me so if you're using an unseen segment the
2:25:22
Caster has to be within 60 feet of that so they're in another room he's probably in that one of the
2:25:28
adjacent rooms where they
2:25:39
so should I make a role in the search yep can you use uh can you use detect magic
2:25:46
to find out where it's coming from
2:25:53
I don't know can I so uh the tech if you have the tech magic I'd have to see the
2:25:59
uh the description for it um as you're you're asking to win the the presence that you're holding down
2:26:06
just deflates I got you
2:26:13
um so yeah you search through and you you don't find anything of note
2:26:20
um what is of note is what you don't find you don't find any luggage you don't
2:26:27
find any signs that they were staying in the room for any length of time you
2:26:33
don't find that they were using the bed yeah this this is just a this is just a
2:26:38
problem the you know just around the room underneath us and set this up
2:26:48
so we just need to find where they are going to knock on the doors on either side you can't read that
2:26:56
sure I just pulled the pull the handle yeah
2:27:04
I mean you could set a fire but yeah yeah I don't think that's necessary
2:27:12
you would really be cementing the party's reputation
2:27:17
and I thought about that I was like I know there's something about a fire that's yeah you know I'll be right back
2:27:23
while you guys well I don't think that we can I don't
2:27:29
think that we can uh we can we go outside the room we'll have to go outside the room and I I don't know if
2:27:34
this cone means anything I hand it to Dwayne you can check that out
2:27:41
um I'm sure that a man of your abilities can figure this out
2:27:48
is is it possible that remind me outside the window and
2:27:53
move over to the adjacent Windows to look in I suppose
2:27:59
um do any of us got ropes hold on
2:28:05
do I have ropes
2:28:12
where did Mike go I don't know he just said he'll be right back okay
2:28:18
um so other than than pinpointing where the spell came from which I don't think you
2:28:24
can uh but it has to be within 60 feet as you said which could be you know three
2:28:30
fours up or down you know um it can't be up right because we were
2:28:36
we were on top of them well I mean it could is there is there for any floor how many floors does this
2:28:43
place have yeah good question I guess it could be above
2:28:48
us cool I'll be right back as well okay
2:28:53
so technically it could be a floor above your room it could be two floors below
2:28:59
their room or it could be on either one of the your room's floors just in a
2:29:05
different room right exactly so
2:29:10
um so Dwayne don't have to figure out what that what that item is and then I'm I'm assuming we just you
2:29:16
know disable it and uh go from there because I'm sure that they can still hear us right you can still
2:29:22
hear us is Howard going to be away from uh just a short time yeah so so I'm
2:29:28
assuming you all can still hear us I I'll like you know get the thing I'm assuming you all can still hear us
2:29:40
oh yes yes and and see you too fantastic I look tired no
2:29:46
I I'm assuming you didn't look at me before and
2:29:53
uh as I said it seems like life has been rough on you oh
2:30:01
so they're they're able to watch us and hear us yeah
2:30:07
although to what degree you're not sure maybe we should split up then and
2:30:13
they probably I'm assuming they can't watch and hear all of us separately in separate locations
2:30:21
how much does Marcus know about magic nothing so uh Howard will have the answer you
2:30:29
know that they've stolen your souls yeah
2:30:38
wow that whole thing a camera steals your soul
2:30:49
like how uh how difficult would it be on this structure to climb outside the
2:30:55
window and climb from window or window to window looking looking in through windows
2:31:01
incredibly hard but if you get seen you're liable to get the guard called onto you for being a Peeping Tom
2:31:07
or or a burglar it was pretty late by this time I mean I think most people are asleep except for
2:31:14
maybe people who are trying to mess with us that and you may see things that you
2:31:19
don't want to see peep in the window of that fat Merchant
2:31:24
see that he's brought company oh
2:31:31
you never know he might be into that it might you know no judgment no judgment
2:31:42
uh I'm of an idea as my idea is to uh maybe send somebody out and
2:31:49
I said just look out the window and look for lights on because they might have their lights on
2:31:59
that's the start I guess maybe I'll uh I'll just kind of stick my head out the window trying to lean out as far as I
2:32:04
can you yeah
2:32:20
there's still about six rooms lit
2:32:25
um not not counting your room
2:32:34
how many could I reasonably kind of walk uh climb outside the window and pure
2:32:40
into I mean the the check's not terribly hard but if you fail you're taking a
2:32:45
four-story fall thank you
2:32:50
I have rope and there's healers in the group
2:33:00
so what is that dexterity that would be the advantage on that it could actually
2:33:06
be strength so you have a fairly good chance of doing it all right
2:33:12
tie a rope around my waist and I'm gonna go uh
2:33:18
good stealthily appear in a couple of windows so
2:33:23
first let's do a stealth check just to see uh how stealthy you specifically are
2:33:31
as you climb around and I am going to have that to be it
2:33:38
all right so I still want to see my dies
2:33:44
ah sorry I I don't know what to tell you man I can see him on on my side I looked in the settings there wasn't
2:33:51
anything definitive about
2:33:56
anyway anyway so that was a terrible wallet um and then we're gonna do uh uh see
2:34:03
where was it so I'm gonna call it
2:34:10
um DC 13.
2:34:16
uh but it's Athletics so you're pretty good at it um however uh after you make your first
2:34:24
movement you you will know that you are not terribly stealthy at this
2:34:33
oh no so I I did hear someone talk about rope
2:34:42
so I'm going to assume that you have people holding a rope at the other end
2:34:47
so who is holding the Rope I am all right and so I'm gonna need to have
2:34:53
you make a strength test uh and then we have a couple people hold
2:35:00
the Rope we've got uh Hamlin and yeah I only had one person speak up so and Galen
2:35:06
um you're pretty beefy and you've got a fair bit of uh gear
2:35:12
so go ahead and give me a strength saving throw
2:35:19
Elmore I'm doing it oh crap so as you're moving along you
2:35:29
know you lament the fact that you're not very stealthy
2:35:35
um but you're you're confident that you can get to it as you jump up to catch the landing above you you realize in
2:35:43
horror that the windowsill is rotted and crumbles away in your hand
2:35:50
you begin the plunge to the ground below four stories hoping that your friends have the Rope
2:35:57
when you feel it jerk and then go slack as you continue your fall unhindered can
2:36:03
I can I try to save it uh yeah go ahead and give me a
2:36:09
well let's see I hope you're faster than 32 feet per second per second
2:36:15
you're gonna have to have some good reaction time I got you what I meant
2:36:20
what I mean what's that what a game and roll I I
2:36:27
don't know he wrote the seven on a target of 15. all right do I have do I just roll it
2:36:34
from my Athletics you know he's not doing the full four
2:36:40
stories just you know am I rolling Athletics what am I rolling I just posted it
2:36:47
oh okay all right hey Mike catch me up just a little bit here two seconds two seconds
2:36:53
all right this will all be over soon [Laughter]
2:36:59
well I have a reaction got it all right so
2:37:06
here here's your chance to win so while you were thinking about this uh
2:37:13
cone and box problem um the party convinced Marcus Maximus to
2:37:19
climb up outside of the building and start falling into your windows that
2:37:26
were lit yeah yeah see that was totally his idea
2:37:31
he wasn't stealthy about it for the first part quite noisy in fact
2:37:38
but not three seconds after he left the windowsill of the room that you're in
2:37:45
you heard oh [ __ ] as he started falling to the ground four
2:37:51
stories below um Galen had the foresight to tie a rope
2:37:58
to him and was holding the Rope as the anchor but he didn't have as good of a grip as
2:38:03
he thought and it immediately ripped loose from his hands then Hamlin attempted to jump on the
2:38:10
Rope before it all played out and he couldn't get a hold of it either
2:38:19
so uh Marcus Maximus is looking at a 40
2:38:24
it's a four-story fall so I'm just going to call it 40 feet okay
2:38:30
well well I will come back do you have any did you see anything
2:38:37
uh I can see all this happening yeah you're in the room
2:38:42
okay I think we I think we better do this right let's see the you couldn't see the
2:38:48
climbing check or the stealth check where he he hit the the ride in windowsill but you definitely saw the
2:38:56
two failed strength saving throws ah you're gonna use feather fall
2:39:03
all right so Maximus says you're you're plunging to your your your
2:39:08
well not death but certainly a painful Landing um you you are shocked and surprised
2:39:16
when your slow Falls to a very Pleasant gentle dissent and you touch down on the
2:39:23
ground four stories below no harm done all right
2:39:29
I'm gonna designate um
2:39:35
everyone but Kelly who should I exclude
2:39:41
[Laughter] um [Music]
2:39:50
well well I will say hamlet isn't like I say uh
2:39:56
yeah all right and one oh exclusive to Hamlet I guess
2:40:03
because I can choose five targets so are you guys like are you telling
2:40:09
what are you what are you telling them um well
2:40:15
I haven't told them anything I I'm just designated the five targets as there was cats in the spell okay
2:40:21
including obviously the following person but yeah of course the only one that really matters
2:40:31
that last war one minute so
2:40:41
I will then tell everyone that they they have featherfall
2:40:47
somebody else climb out there yeah one minute
2:40:53
all right that first guy I never had faith in him but you you I have faith in get out there and climb that building
2:41:02
all right that second guy I never trusted him not really he didn't have his heart into it but you you are gonna
2:41:10
make it uh go back in the building and try to
2:41:18
work my way back up for a room Are You Gonna climb up or just use the stairs
2:41:23
um I gotta just use the stairs all right so you'll be back up in a round or two
2:41:30
um as far as the the cone and box that you've been examining Howard
2:41:36
uh as far as you can tell it is a quite clever modification of the message spell
2:41:44
um Amplified somehow by this parchment cone
2:41:51
so they message plus
2:41:57
unseen servant plus Clairvoyance that's three concentration spells
2:42:03
you're assuming that one person is casting no when they're not using a magic item
2:42:09
I'm not making that assumption at all I'm just I'm you're counting I'm counting
2:42:20
I really don't my character doesn't know how all this magic stuff works either so
2:42:27
are you encouraging someone else to try the climb uh Howard or are you just telling them if anyone
2:42:34
wants to go you've got a minute yeah I told him you've got Philly fall for the next minute
2:42:39
right um you you also are hearing a lot of noise from outside as people are
2:42:46
uh opening their windows and yelling you know what's going on out there I'll call the watch on you
2:42:54
what happened to my windowsill
2:43:00
I'm gonna close our window
2:43:06
well uh I'm assuming Marcus still has the Rope
2:43:11
attached to him also yes he did take the rope with him yes
2:43:17
so I'm gonna close the window and I'm gonna gather my rope from Marcus when he gets there yeah yeah yeah I don't know
2:43:24
if he voluntarily took the rope with him that's voluntary not voluntary either
2:43:31
way he took the Rope
2:43:41
so I'm not hearing anybody volunteering to climb the window is closed so what is
2:43:47
the party doing
2:43:52
uh everyone who needs to sleep maybe try to attempt sleep again maybe that get rid of that little uh message thing
2:44:00
or whatever
2:44:05
maybe that's whatever they're doing is wore out or something and so folks can
2:44:10
sleep or you could just break it
2:44:16
oh and I almost forgot uh the marble that was also on the table
2:44:22
that was the focus point for Clairvoyance it's apparently a magic
2:44:27
item of some sort um and after examining it you are sure that it works as a paired set
2:44:36
oh well I'm Gonna Keep it I'm hanging on to that then sure but I have to put it in something where
2:44:42
they can't see everything so I'm going to put in a container all right
2:44:49
so you drop it in like a scroll case or something like that or your backpack or
2:44:54
something yeah some pocket my backpack all right wrap it up in a cloth make sure they can't see anything
2:45:00
sure all right you wrap that up and tuck it away
2:45:05
Whitney also need Clara audience to hear he didn't find a device for that
2:45:14
it's safe to assume that there probably is one since they seem to be using devices for everything else
2:45:20
but you didn't find it
2:45:27
and uh Jason's character checked all the adjacent uh yes that's correct Mark
2:45:34
Marcus uh did did search and said that he didn't find anything okay
2:45:43
I think he did that while you were uh wrestling with the Unseen servant right
2:45:49
speaking of which Howard your unseen servant is still breaking things no no no no running out of things to break
2:45:56
what's that I told it to open the door oh right right are you are you having it doing anything
2:46:03
else I just pick up the room clean up clean up the room tidy up the
2:46:09
room yeah I could tell it to do that sure
2:46:14
you you all you swear you hear a and then it begins to clean up the room
2:46:29
[Applause] are you kidding me
2:46:35
I hate that hole now fill it in and take another hole move that pile of sandbags
2:46:40
over there now move it back yeah yep that's funny
2:46:46
all right so you guys are heading back up to your room
2:46:52
can you tell the Unseen servant to no you really can't do it they they
2:46:57
don't they don't think about themselves the Unseen servants are not intelligent no they just do
2:47:04
but apparently apparently they can be Chagrin even though they're not
2:47:11
I like that touch I like the one that like got mad and
2:47:16
broke the broomstick over me
2:47:21
well
2:47:26
so you guys are heading back up to your room sure or are you leaving the end or what
2:47:32
are you doing is there another inn nearby you're not really familiar with the area
2:47:38
but you might be able to find something I mean oh it is past midnight so yeah
2:47:49
I got alarms all over the room so I'm just gonna go back there all right leave the Unseen servant to uh
2:47:57
tidy up as best he can well we broke the toy too so
2:48:03
we have to assume that they wouldn't instantly be able to reinstall it
2:48:15
all right so you guys head back up to your room
2:48:21
quite late now um and I will say that everybody that
2:48:29
failed The Conch yet before um which was everybody but Hamlin and imaco
2:48:37
and Galen um because of the interruption in sleep
2:48:43
because of the nerves because of anticipation of more dirty tricks you
2:48:49
you actually get a very poor night's sleep and everyone other than the ones that I
2:48:58
mentioned take one level of exhaustion
2:49:06
sleep later in the morning yeah yeah I mean
2:49:11
really Warriors right so we get four hours
2:49:17
sleep that's a whole level of exhaustion out of out of a number of levels yes
2:49:26
all right how do I deduct exhaustion
2:49:34
zero to one
2:49:44
so yeah you only have one level of exhaustion out of six possible yeah so
2:49:49
it's not like it's a huge impairment it's just you didn't get a good night's sleep
2:49:55
does that mean of a long rest what's that we don't get the benefit of a long rest
2:50:02
uh you you get the you get the benefits of a long rest you just didn't get sleep
2:50:11
I I don't quite know how to describe it but it's it's basically um your rest was was enough to get you
2:50:19
back the benefits of a long rest so you can memorize spells or refresh spell slots
2:50:25
or whatnot but you you didn't truly rest
2:50:31
is what I'm saying yeah the the party was was pegged on
2:50:38
there was people like I really want to get a hold of these guys and ring their necks
2:50:44
um yeah the party was worked up
2:50:51
so change exhaustion from zero to one that's it
2:50:56
all right um can I take a long rest then
2:51:02
yeah anybody who wants to can click the long rest button to refill uh resources
2:51:13
um but you were saying that Maximus did didn't need to take an exhaustion right I forgot no you
2:51:21
Hamlin and Elmore
2:51:26
Elmore doesn't technically sleep he just meditates for an hour right because he's an elf right now
2:51:34
Amico and Hamlin both rolled you know you you met or beat the target
2:51:40
which was only 12 by the way um everybody else didn't
2:51:47
okay I was just mixing up who wasn't wasn't
2:52:01
it and it is now the next day although Brad has left
2:52:07
um what what's the party going to uh
2:52:13
do for the day are you gonna look for more uh Clues and references rumors
2:52:19
yeah well uh before I go too much further
2:52:26
yes oh you want to do your uh well that's
2:52:33
um okay that's very mid oh wait it added them together what did
2:52:38
it so
2:52:43
very middle of the road rolls
2:52:50
so I will remind the party again how the rumors work uh it's five hours per attempt and since
2:52:57
you're not coming in from out of town I'll let everybody make two rolls or or
2:53:04
at least groups of people can make two rolls if you're working together
2:53:10
um each attempt takes five hours so we're talking a 10 hour day
2:53:17
um and you're either using uh persuasion deception you know
2:53:22
soft skills at a cost of 15 gold to basically spread
2:53:29
some money and alcohol around to get some information or
2:53:35
purely going the the pi route of Investigation uh perception
2:53:43
where you you have no you don't have to spend any money I have investigation uh
2:53:48
insight and sure I'm just telling the the party
2:53:54
there's two ways to go about it one is uh a more Charisma based where you're
2:53:59
you're trying to uh schmooze in in one way or another you
2:54:05
know either persuasion intimidation deception you know your pick
2:54:10
uh with a little bit of money spread around to get some info or you're doing
2:54:17
a purely investigative root
2:54:23
so first question is the party going separately or together
2:54:33
um let's say we divide up maybe one group takes one approach and the other group takes the other approach
2:54:39
so two groups of three yeah so maybe
2:54:45
um I would be better with investigation okay I too would be better well I have
2:54:52
investigation as a as a skill I do too and I have inside what I would
2:54:59
allow since you're going to do it as a group is who you know the entire group
2:55:04
can roll say investigation and then the result is the average of those roles
2:55:12
the entire group that's actually investigating versus uh offering money or whatever yes
2:55:20
the persuasion route versus the investigation right and you can both do you both
2:55:26
groups could do investigation both groups could do charisma uh it's however you want to break it
2:55:33
down man but but each group has to be consistent I can't average two investigations and a persuasion
2:55:42
so my investigation is
2:55:48
zero and my persuasion is negative one
2:55:56
I don't want Jason on my team sounds like he's going to be spending
2:56:01
some money [Laughter] [Music] and I have yeah I have Insight is good
2:56:08
and perception is good but everything else as far as just anything Charisma is bad
2:56:18
well investigation is intelligent
2:56:24
so first who's going with what route so what well just because of the way
2:56:30
Discord is is laid out for me I'm going to call Howard the investigation group and Aaron is the Charisma group so who
2:56:37
is going with Howard come on
2:56:45
who does the wind pick for his team yeah oh oh I'm A minus one on Investigation
2:56:53
my Charisma is not awesome but whatever two-person teams
2:57:00
Jason said two three-person teams and no one said anything so and unless
2:57:06
who's fine I I have a I have a I have a decent Charisma obviously uh although I don't
2:57:13
have persuasion I have investigation which is odd so
2:57:19
um
2:57:27
so just to speed things along we're going to do kickball rules Howard pick somebody
2:57:33
well well I I think obviously uh
2:57:38
Matt's character goes with the investigation Team all right Aaron pick somebody
2:57:45
um no wait Matt is a paladin yeah I'm a I'm a Charisma guy I said I do have an
2:57:52
investigation but it's only a plus one yeah I'll take Matt okay I mean
2:57:59
okay that's fine
2:58:08
Aaron who did you pick all right Matt's going to be the muscle then this is our decision on how we're going
2:58:15
to divide up our team right but you guys were we're dithering and no one was making any choices so I'm
2:58:23
trying again
2:58:28
don't have any so obviously it's gonna be Matt Nye and
2:58:34
amiko and then the other three on the other team there you go that's good that's good that's good
2:58:41
all right all right
2:58:53
can we not do three teams is there a reason why we can't do three things
2:59:01
there was no particular reason okay Jason said let's do two teams and everyone let's do three teams okay right
2:59:09
if we could have one person support the other right yep that gives us three rolls of advantage
2:59:17
I don't know what that does for our division now but uh I would say Matt could do one team persuasion I can do
2:59:24
one team persuasion somebody can help us and then the two you know knuckle draggers well no
2:59:32
because you could help me with my persuasion I think you would say that you're helpers yeah
2:59:39
yeah all right all right so I'll take Galen Galen will help me
2:59:46
and then baby Nico could help Matt and then all right so what room are you going Brad that investigation or
2:59:53
Christmas president charisma and then uh
2:59:59
Elmore is going to help yeah and then that a little mad will go persuasion yep any particular Charisma
3:00:06
uh you've got deception intimidation or persuasion uh I could look I think persuasion was
3:00:14
the highest yeah persuasion is my highest
3:00:22
I don't know what Matt says but what's your intimidation uh
3:00:28
well it's going to be the same thing as my persuasion Well mine's not yes because you have one
3:00:35
of those as a as a skill correct all right so you're going to do
3:00:41
persuasion so there you go and it's an advantage because you're getting help from Elmore
3:00:50
yes wow all right
3:00:57
do I just roll or are you gonna put a box up there for me I I will come to you
3:01:03
boom look at that oops all right so
3:01:08
you find out that um someone named still says he's seen some
3:01:16
really strange things going on along the southern sword Coast from from waterdeep
3:01:23
uh unfortunately he's in jail for brawling [Music]
3:01:29
he had a little too much to drink couldn't hold his liquor started a fight and now he's in jail
3:01:38
you have to go bail him out what was his name still y-s-t-i-l
3:01:46
Ife this is silent why right
3:01:52
why because I can yeah all right Matt all right
3:02:01
oh and it was uh 15 gold Brad okay you can split that with your helper
3:02:07
if you want or you can pay it all right dude man he rolled so well I would think that it would cost less that's good okay
3:02:13
are you gonna put a box up for me or am I putting this question I need to know what route you're taking persuasion so he saw something along the southern
3:02:19
sword Coast yes yeah instilled in okay
3:02:26
and he's in jail and he's in jail for drunken brawling yes
3:02:31
you're you're doing Charisma man yeah uh persuasion intimidation persuade
3:02:38
I don't know how I would intimidate the yes I could but
3:02:45
you're rescue you're a big man you grab a hold of him and say talk right
3:02:51
okay
3:02:57
oh unfortunately you come up flat wow you
3:03:03
rolled too sweaty roll I didn't even couldn't even see it uh you rolled a three and a one okay no
3:03:10
yep yep that was terrible so pretty shitty left but you still you still
3:03:16
spent 15 gold okay uh who is your helper uh
3:03:21
emico all right uh Jason or Howard yes
3:03:28
[Music] investigation route I'm assuming uh yes
3:03:33
yeah I mean Howard should roll right or do you both roll no it's he rolls but uh you're giving
3:03:41
him help so he gets to do it at Advantage there we go
3:03:50
right on it meet it or Beat It congratulations I can't see any rules
3:03:56
yeah I think it's when you prompt us Mike that we don't see the rules
3:04:04
I seem to I see him when like when it's not a group everybody rolling I see it
3:04:10
the individual rules except for my own I just want to try it
3:04:21
yeah yeah that one so there was a setting for it
3:04:28
all right so what did I roll for id20 I didn't
3:04:38
think um you you don't get anything specific
3:04:44
but after spending the morning talking to people there's pretty much a consensus in the
3:04:50
trade Ward there's an awful lot of people new in the ward asking a lot of questions
3:04:56
weird questions about eyes
3:05:02
okay a lot of people asking about eyes yep
3:05:08
so everybody's hunting for the eye hey everybody wants the eye the eyes have it
3:05:13
um did you you didn't say it but I will let you retroactively say are you guys meeting anywhere at that midday are you
3:05:21
gonna go right to the yeah I think we're gonna we're gonna meet uh and exchange notes over lunch
3:05:28
sure uh any particular place
3:05:36
uh same place where it probably makes sense yeah because
3:05:42
we don't want to make it hard for the guys tailing us yeah right right
3:05:48
well I mean if we see them we can grab them right I mean that was
3:05:54
the whole idea going in their room last night was to grab them I mean
3:05:59
yeah we'll just claim they were welching they owe us money
3:06:05
all right so as you guys are meeting up and and walking back to the honorable
3:06:12
night um let's see what the D is
3:06:19
so um one of the kids that you vaguely remember
3:06:25
uh approaches you and says says you you're looking for the eye
3:06:32
right to who the the party
3:06:39
he's a spokesperson Al I I don't know I mean's the local
3:06:47
you speak the party yeah well where do we recognize the kid from
3:06:52
uh you're not entirely certain but you think that he was at the uh the mob
3:06:59
yesterday okay or of course he was so he was not intimidated of my my meteor
3:07:06
shower he did run you're not throwing meteor showers now
3:07:11
is that the [ __ ] kid no it's just a regular kid let's make him [ __ ]
3:07:18
good dripple in but it is broad daylight Tiny Tim's brother
3:07:23
so I asked him well what do you know about the eye
3:07:28
not much sir I was hired by some people to look around and try and find it but
3:07:35
they're not very nice um I was hoping John Smith
3:07:43
I don't know they didn't say the name they just give some food and and we look
3:07:51
for it um
3:07:57
they they there's an alley that it's off the uh nose Flower Street
3:08:05
down south you you guys are uh kind of around the
3:08:11
soothsayer way around Freight here okay and and the the alley that he's talking
3:08:17
about is over here okay um
3:08:24
that they there's some some people there in a shop it's a noble abandoned Taylor
3:08:29
shop that's where they work out of
3:08:35
I'm I'm hoping you know maybe you can see fit to give me some coin I it's just me I I got
3:08:43
nobody else and there's not really work for someone my size absolutely so how much to tell us where
3:08:50
the Trap is I don't know of any trap
3:08:55
well let's I let's let's go about this an entirely different way
3:09:01
how about we tell the kid that he found us and and he's convinced that we already have the eye
3:09:07
and and to tell them some place where they can come after us and we'll we'll uh we'll be ready for
3:09:15
them as long as that don't get me wrong I like the idea of killing some people but
3:09:21
maybe we ought to just use him as a spy and having come report to us when he hears something you know if they find
3:09:29
something [Music] foreign foreign
3:09:46
here's the deal um foreign
3:09:53
[Laughter] [Music]
3:10:04
um you could find us at the audible night if you hear anything let them let us
3:10:10
know but don't tell those other guys anything right
3:10:18
is that it that's it that's all we got right now anyone else got anything nope
3:10:25
it works for us now right just tell them to come by and we'll buy him dinner
3:10:30
every night you can come well do we want to do that though I mean
3:10:36
yeah to your to your point of making it easier for the other guys to find us
3:10:41
maybe we ought to maybe you ought to meet him someplace else to buy them dinner and
3:10:47
you can talk it over you know what I mean like we could split up like you were talking about
3:10:53
to make it harder to track US
3:10:59
all right I would have written several things so far so what what's the actual uh instructions for the kid well that's
3:11:06
what we're talking about right now yeah I I didn't know if you were done yet no tell us what he hears it's up to to
3:11:14
win it's his contact so it's up to win what he wants to do with
3:11:21
uh yeah I think I think having a regular recurring contact point at the same point of the
3:11:28
day so you know dinner time at The Honorable night
3:11:34
I don't know we're going to go someplace besides the honorable night
3:11:39
I don't know of any other places do I know of any other places uh
3:11:45
we can get a bite that's by far the most famous one but you know you there's there's without a question you could
3:11:52
find there's dozens of Inns and taverns
3:11:59
and and you know other stories I I I really think we should go to that
3:12:06
store and drop in to those guys yeah
3:12:11
I agree okay
3:12:17
so you you want the kid to report in each day at dinner time at The Honorable
3:12:24
night yeah and we're gonna ask him to kind of lead us
3:12:30
to where this place is and then just so we can see it and then after he's gone
3:12:37
then maybe we drop in on the on the the old abandoned tailor shop and see who's in there all right
3:12:43
so he he takes you through and he's kind of giving you like he's very excited
3:12:50
um and he's just like the whole time he's just too fisted clutch these these
3:12:55
five gold coins um and he's talking about yeah like a kid
3:13:02
does he's kind of rambling about everything like telling you what it's like on the
3:13:07
streets telling you about how he hasn't eaten in a long time telling you about how his ma died telling you about how
3:13:13
his paw was a mercenary and ran out on them yeah just a Non-Stop narration
3:13:22
um but you you get to the the alley within reasonable time did his father have a strange Russian
3:13:28
accent [Laughter] no he does not mention any accidents he
3:13:36
gets you guys to about here and the shop is down toward the end
3:13:42
um and he kind of points it out it's it's pretty obvious that that this particular
3:13:49
uh shop and like all the the buildings in this area it's kind of one of those
3:13:54
multi-use you know business on the ground floor tenement on the upper floors and by
3:14:02
upper floors I'm talking like three stories is pretty much the average
3:14:07
um and this this building is no different um the tailor shop is partly boarded up
3:14:15
um and sealed off uh in obvious disrepair they're easy
3:14:21
like garbage you know swept up and kind of piled up in a haphazard wind blown
3:14:28
fashion in front of this job [Music] um
3:14:33
and it has every appearance of being abandoned
3:14:45
can I perceive any traps or anything or people looking at us
3:14:54
do
3:15:04
so you can certainly make a perception role
3:15:11
so let's do that anybody else want to do a perception role sure I'll help him do
3:15:17
a perception he'll help him do he's already got Advantage okay one two sure
3:15:27
help me or I can help you I don't know can we help on perception
3:15:32
rules now that I think about it um you know you could both effectively
3:15:39
both of you be scanning the the area looking for things that are suspicious a
3:15:44
spotter if you will all right I'll help somebody
3:15:50
what's your wisdom sorry well you just roll an advantage
3:15:57
okay I put both of you in there just so that
3:16:03
I could remember that he's getting Advantage okay all right
3:16:10
so Galen go ahead and you do not beat the perception check
3:16:18
so while while it is seedy and dirty and and most certainly smelly it seems
3:16:27
safe enough right uh who else is going to make the perception roll
3:16:33
I am not getting good rolls
3:16:39
I I would say legade because we're talking about something
3:16:44
that's visual right
3:16:49
[Music] what is it to win with his uh with his bird
3:16:56
oh that's the one okay yeah the bird automatically gets advantage on visual checks okay and then
3:17:04
what about somebody else another pair yeah so Mike when you prompt me like
3:17:11
that I don't get to die oh you don't get that ice uh for some reason it's because it's not
3:17:18
used to having a person owning two
3:17:23
um let me try this
3:17:47
yeah that did it I changed the the token on the board
3:17:53
with one from the sidebar that had ownership from you
3:18:02
the gate says it looks okay okay
3:18:08
anybody else yeah I wanted to do it uh or somebody who has a higher wisdom
3:18:13
movie anybody give any help I would hope so we've got uh
3:18:23
Duane's done uh Sassy's done the only person is emigo so yeah what's
3:18:31
your perception doesn't matter she's she's giving a help actually I'm just assisting him okay
3:18:38
I I'm putting the helpers in the request just so that I can keep track so that
3:18:43
it's not everybody helping everybody I cannot see that yellow freaking dice
3:18:50
there's a yellow dye it keeps coming up and I cannot see it uh he did okay it didn't it didn't
3:18:57
matter because you didn't yeah yeah I saw that everybody has agreed that it it looks abandoned it's fried
3:19:05
all right well it's either abandoned or they're
3:19:11
all inside you know right yep
3:19:19
do we want to case it from like the distance
3:19:27
what are we casing it for I don't know I mean are we going in to talk to these
3:19:33
guys are we going into kill them what are we doing here
3:19:39
well what do you want to do
3:19:46
oh no sound effects
3:19:53
all right so take a look at the uh the order of
3:20:00
grouping and tell me if it changes
3:20:06
where is the store it's a relationship the stories is directly to the south of
3:20:12
the party
3:20:17
that music what's the marching order well uh let's put a Miko and to win in
3:20:25
the middle how about everybody just arrange your character in relation to everybody else
3:20:32
roughly in the area that you're at who's in the front to absorb damage is that going to be me
3:20:38
sure
3:20:45
or each Square 10 feet oh there I am it's normal it's five
3:20:53
foreign order and then I can uh
3:21:03
who's up front
3:21:10
are we missing somebody or no okay
3:21:16
all right well the gate is missing but well okay let me let me drag legade in
3:21:23
[Music]
3:21:28
[ __ ]
3:21:34
does the bird want to be in front well he's I I assume that the bird is at
3:21:41
elevation what what elevation okay uh you know probably 20 feet in the
3:21:46
air oh you're a 36 years
3:21:52
your uh your rooftops are are 40 feet up aren't they
3:21:58
uh yeah
3:22:04
but but 20 feet is sufficient to put him out of Harm's Way of any melee attack on the ground
3:22:12
yeah that's the goal is is this the formation
3:22:19
well I'm looking on the back
3:22:27
well she's a cleric I mean it's not like she's are there a lot of people around
3:22:34
uh you know this is kind of a a back alley so no
3:22:40
all right I'm equipped at least not during the day there might be people that return at night to the tenements
3:22:49
meteor storm I'm gonna draw my sword
3:22:54
uh a.m you'll get to do that once combat starts right now I'm just trying to get you guys is your order
3:23:02
okay is this where we're happy uh
3:23:09
I think so yes what what am I what are we looking at here we see some I will tell you is
3:23:16
it is I know what order of marching order three
3:23:26
all right so the the scene as you approach this abandoned tailor shop
3:23:33
is
3:23:38
from the rooftops
3:23:45
you have a group of thugs up here at the edge of the roofs
3:23:53
and each one of them Hucks a large clay
3:23:58
vial at the party oh man and we're gonna say they live here
3:24:05
they've been here they land here
3:24:12
um I was just wondering is everybody doing okay for a Time
3:24:18
this we can set up I can set up the combat stage and then uh we can pick it
3:24:23
up here if that's the case so they they Huck their Earthen vials
3:24:29
which shatter on the street around you um from the vials you see what looks
3:24:36
like a pile of maggots riding on the street and I will but but then the the pile
3:24:45
begins to float up about chest High and in your mind you hear me
3:24:57
you say meat can you turn the volume down a little bit on the on the background music yeah
3:25:11
he shared the image I don't see anything don't see anything all right I'll send
3:25:18
it to chat that worked
3:25:23
no so these rubs load up
3:25:29
surrounded by a nimbus of electricity in a number of swarms of these loading
3:25:40
telepathically screaming grubs oh my God in your mind that you are meat
3:25:48
okay come get some nice places to see the images
3:25:56
the forge chat yeah yeah oh okay in chat okay
3:26:03
oh nice
3:26:09
now individually they're only a couple inches in size but there there's a large
3:26:15
swarm of them oh um we will roll initiative
3:26:20
and then if we are out of time then that's where we will pick up next week okay do you prompt us for initiative on
3:26:28
this one on this new
3:26:33
or if you put everyone in combat yeah
3:26:39
that is a lot of targets yeah but what I'm going to do is I'm going to just do theirs with a roll
3:26:50
Jesus Christ and then
3:26:55
[Music]
3:27:05
is it dimly lit here no no it's daylight okay
3:27:14
well that time I didn't have a actual die roll it just appeared
3:27:27
is that say Jason yeah yeah I'm just checking that
3:27:34
Warhammer and it gives me Advantage right uh I'd have to look I'm looking
3:27:44
bonuses on perception yeah it gives me advantage on an initiative
3:27:51
yeah me too I don't know if it did two nice rules or not it did okay
3:27:58
you rolled a one and an eight oh my God
3:28:03
I am rolling terrible
3:28:13
music's feeding back to Jason's computer [Music]
3:28:19
what's up the music's feeding back during the computer
3:28:24
it's loud enough to key your mic Aaron you're the only one who hasn't rolled
3:28:31
um I I thought I rolled already nope that's weird because I I saw a three
3:28:39
yeah I see it I was okay with the three actually
3:28:48
all right and since I'm being told that it's close to time then we will pick
3:28:53
this up next game um I will like I'd like to give the experience though okay so
3:29:00
um for the party you guys actually did
3:29:08
a lot of interesting things a lot of uh things that I really liked I liked the
3:29:14
um the interactions that you guys had with the bobs um
3:29:22
which would be the the John Smith's yes um I I liked Duane's interaction with
3:29:28
him I like Matt's you know uh Pam I I gotta get used to your name
3:29:34
handling yeah Hamlin's uh interactions with him uh I liked the
3:29:42
the thief hilariously failed attempt at helpfully climbing along the outside
3:29:50
and and Howard's excellent save of it so yes yes I am going to give everybody a flat 400
3:29:58
experience points for this session well I I think it was a good session I
3:30:03
think there was a lot of uh interesting interactions
3:30:08
and I I hope that we continue to have everybody interacting good
3:30:18
Jason's computer
3:30:23
should I uh mute
3:30:29
we can you can you can douse the music for now I already did oh okay
3:30:35
any music you hear at this point is is solely coming from Jason's computer
3:30:41
oh all right so do you guys have any
3:30:47
is is the pacing going okay I feel like it's a little bit slower than I expected
3:30:53
to be honest I don't think it's bad I I think that's on us
3:30:59
and that that's fine as long as the party is not feeling frustrated with the pacing and is having fun then it's it
3:31:07
all works right having uh
3:31:13
having a lot of dialogue interaction and uh you know moving at a faster Pace I
3:31:19
think we can move it make quick decisions I'm trying to help with that a little bit by like prompting yeah
3:31:27
hey I do have something to say on that and and I kind of uh felt the
3:31:32
frustration from uh Brad instead of like saying all right this is what we're
3:31:37
gonna do I think he just just prompt us to hey you need to make a decision right now as far as what we're gonna do
3:31:44
instead of just you know making the what we think is the choice that's the problem but I agree I agree with what
3:31:51
you were doing there in the fact that that you know hey time's ticking away let's let's let's let's make a decision
3:32:00
yeah and I think that is on us as the group I mean we need to just kind of
3:32:05
like not try to overthink it too much right and just make it make a decision
3:32:11
you know and and I just go ahead keep keep the game moving yep
3:32:19
so I I was going to say that uh Duane as a character is not built to be a leader
3:32:27
um he's just he's just not he's not right for it but we have two natural leaders
3:32:33
in the party and that's two paladins they really ought to be you've got two paladins and then uh Marcus is his
3:32:41
backstory is if you don't mind me saying no no he's definitely he's a he's a
3:32:48
leader of his family he's the the family head and the lead of his his family at a
3:32:53
barbarian Prime so technically you've got three
3:32:59
right so I I think um due to the longevity of being in the
3:33:07
party I think cese is probably the most logical [Music] um
3:33:12
you know I was up and down a lot tonight so that that's some of that's on me so
3:33:18
yeah no but I I'm just I'm just trying to say we should probably
3:33:24
start to funnel our suggestions into a leader of leaders and then
3:33:31
you know yeah I agree with that and I don't mind
3:33:36
making decisions and um as well as um I think the rest of us kind of mind you
3:33:42
making decisions
3:33:49
Hamlin would certainly make some decisions but I'm not sure that the rest of the part here bro
3:33:57
I suppose as a leader of Barbarian that's what you do you climb out the window with the rope light on yeah I was
3:34:04
gonna say that's one of the things I was going to say is that that those of us who have a a character with a with like
3:34:11
for instance a low intelligence that that that certainly was a was a correct
3:34:16
decision I mean that plan
3:34:22
exactly I mean you know well it was you know I don't think our decisions are
3:34:28
likely to wipe out all of us right so
3:34:39
just a little just a little off tonight I think um
3:34:47
right so that any role he makes would have been an advantage um are we gonna give out individual
3:34:53
experience we used to do that yeah yeah that's totally a thing if anybody wants to give out experience
3:35:00
okay I do want to take just a very quick
3:35:05
second to just remind that um if if someone does something it's that's inspiring during the game and is
3:35:12
short and Inspiration Point feel free to speak up and say so and give them an
3:35:17
Inspiration Point you do get to give a freebie all right hey I'm gonna go ahead and stop the stream unless you guys want
3:35:24
to have this on the record
